                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is co-administered with sofosbuvir in combination with another HCV direct acting antiviral, including OLYSIO. A fatal cardiac arrest was reported in a patient receiving a sofosbuvir-containing regimen (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir). Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with co-administration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this bradycardia effect is unknown.</paragraph>

These trials included a total of 1178 subjects who received OLYSIO or placebo in combination with 24 or 48 weeks of Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV. Of the 1178 subjects, 781 subjects were randomized to receive OLYSIO 150 mg once daily for 12 weeks and 397 subjects were randomized to receive placebo once daily for 12 weeks.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In the pooled Phase 3 safety data, the majority of the adverse reactions reported during 12 weeks treatment with OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV were Grade 1 to 2 in severity. Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were reported in 23% of subjects receiving OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV versus 25% of subjects receiving placebo in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 2% of subjects receiving OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV and in 3% of subjects receiving placebo in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV. Discontinuation of OLYSIO or placebo due to adverse reactions occurred in 2% and 1% of subjects receiving OLYSIO with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV and subjects receiving placebo with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV, respectively.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>In the Phase 3 clinical trials, rash (including photosensitivity reactions) was observed in 28% of OLYSIO-treated subjects compared to 20% of placebo-treated subjects during the 12 weeks of treatment with OLYSIO or placebo in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV. Fifty-six percent (56%) of rash events in the OLYSIO group occurred in the first 4 weeks, with 42% of cases occurring in the first 2 weeks. Most of the rash events in OLYSIO-treated subjects were of mild or moderate severity (Grade 1 or Grade 2). Severe (Grade 3) rash occurred in 1% of OLYSIO-treated subjects and in none of the placebo-treated subjects. There were no reports of life-threatening (Grade 4) rash. Discontinuation of OLYSIO or placebo due to rash occurred in 1% of OLYSIO-treated subjects, compared to less than 1% of placebo-treated subjects. The frequencies of rash and photosensitivity reactions were higher in subjects with higher simeprevir exposures.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>All subjects enrolled in the Phase 3 trials were directed to use sun protection measures. In these trials, adverse reactions under the specific category of photosensitivity were reported in 5% of OLYSIO-treated subjects compared to 1% of placebo-treated subjects during the 12 weeks of treatment with OLYSIO or placebo in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV. Most photosensitivity reactions in OLYSIO-treated subjects were of mild or moderate severity (Grade 1 or 2). Two OLYSIO-treated subjects experienced photosensitivity reactions which resulted in hospitalization. No life-threatening photosensitivity reactions were reported.</paragraph>

All dyspnea events reported in OLYSIO-treated subjects were of mild or moderate severity (Grade 1 or 2). There were no Grade 3 or 4 dyspnea events reported and no subjects discontinued treatment with OLYSIO due to dyspnea. Sixty-one percent (61%) of dyspnea events occurred in the first 4 weeks of treatment with OLYSIO.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Simeprevir mildly inhibits CYP1A2 activity and intestinal CYP3A4 activity, but does not affect hepatic CYP3A4 activity. Co-administration of OLYSIO with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs (see <linkHtml href="#t6">Table 6</linkHtml>). Simeprevir does not affect CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP2D6 <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Simeprevir inhibits OATP1B1/3 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporters. Co-administration of OLYSIO with drugs that are substrates for OATP1B1/3 and P-gp transport may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs (see <linkHtml href="#t6">Table 6</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The primary enzyme involved in the biotransformation of simeprevir is CYP3A <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>. Clinically relevant effects of other drugs on simeprevir pharmacokinetics via CYP3A may occur. Co-administration of OLYSIO with moderate or strong inhibitors of CYP3A may significantly increase the plasma exposure of simeprevir. Co-administration with moderate or strong inducers of CYP3A may significantly reduce the plasma exposure of simeprevir and lead to loss of efficacy (see <linkHtml href="#t6">Table 6</linkHtml>). Therefore, co-administration of OLYSIO with substances that are moderate or strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A is not recommended <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S5.7">Warnings and Precautions (5.7)</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#S12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                  <renderMultiMedia referencedObject="MM1"/>
                  <paragraph>Simeprevir drug substance is a white to almost white powder. Simeprevir is practically insoluble in water over a wide pH range. It is practically insoluble in propylene glycol, very slightly soluble in ethanol, and slightly soluble in acetone. It is soluble in dichloromethane and freely soluble in some organic solvents (e.g., tetrahydrofuran and N,N-dimethylformamide).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>OLYSIO (simeprevir) for oral administration is available as 150 mg strength hard gelatin capsules. Each capsule contains 154.4 mg of simeprevir sodium salt, which is equivalent to 150 mg of simeprevir. OLYSIO (simeprevir) capsules contain the following inactive ingredients: colloidal anhydrous silica, croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate and sodium lauryl sulphate. The white capsule contains gelatin and titanium dioxide (E171) and is printed with ink containing iron oxide black (E172) and shellac (E904).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetic properties of simeprevir have been evaluated in healthy adult subjects and in adult HCV-infected subjects. Plasma C<sub>max</sub> and AUC increased more than dose-proportionally after multiple doses between 75 mg and 200 mg once daily, with accumulation occurring following repeated dosing. Steady-state was reached after 7 days of once daily dosing. Plasma exposure (AUC) of simeprevir in HCV-infected subjects was about 2- to 3-fold higher compared to that observed in HCV-uninfected subjects. Plasma C<sub>max</sub> and AUC of simeprevir were similar during co-administration of simeprevir with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV compared with administration of simeprevir alone. In HCV-infected subjects, the mean steady-state predose plasma concentration was 1936 ng/mL (standard deviation: 2640) and the mean steady-state AUC<sub>24</sub> was 57469 ng.h/mL (standard deviation: 63571).</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Elimination of simeprevir occurs via biliary excretion. Renal clearance plays an insignificant role in its elimination. Following a single oral administration of 200 mg <sup>14</sup>C-simeprevir to healthy subjects, on average 91% of the total radioactivity was recovered in feces. Less than 1% of the administered dose was recovered in urine. Unchanged simeprevir in feces accounted for on average 31% of the administered dose.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>Renal elimination of simeprevir is negligible.

Based on the observed and expected changes in simeprevir exposure, no dose adjustment of OLYSIO is needed in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment. The safety and efficacy of OLYSIO have not been studied in HCV-infected patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease, including patients requiring dialysis <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S8.7">Use in Specific Populations (8.7)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

Chimeric replicons carrying NS3 sequences derived from HCV protease inhibitor treatment-naïve genotype 1a- or genotype 1b-infected patients displayed median fold change (FC) in EC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.4 (interquartile range, IQR: 0.8 to 11; N=78) and 0.4 (IQR: 0.3 to 0.7; N=59) compared to reference genotype 1b replicon, respectively. Genotype 1a (N=33) and 1b (N=2) isolates with a baseline Q80K polymorphism resulted in median FC in simeprevir EC<sub>50</sub> value of 11 (IQR: 7.4 to 13) and 8.4, respectively. Chimeric replicons carrying NS3 sequences derived from HCV protease inhibitor treatment-naïve genotype 4a-, 4d-, or 4r-infected patients displayed median FC in EC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.5 (IQR: 0.4 to 0.6; N=38), 0.4 (IQR: 0.2 to 0.5; N=24), and 1.6 (IQR: 0.7 to 4.5; N=8), compared to reference genotype 1b replicon, respectively. A pooled analysis of chimeric replicons carrying the NS3 sequences from HCV protease inhibitor-naïve patients infected with other HCV genotype 4 subtypes, including 4c (N=1), 4e (N=2), 4f (N=3), 4h (N=3), 4k (N=1), 4o (N=2), 4q (N=2), or unidentified subtype (N=7) displayed a median FC in EC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.7 (IQR: 0.5 to 1.1; N=21) compared to reference genotype 1b replicon. The presence of 50% human serum reduced simeprevir replicon activity by 2.4-fold. Combination of simeprevir with IFN, RBV, NS5A inhibitors, nucleoside analog NS5B polymerase inhibitors or non-nucleoside analog NS5B polymerase inhibitors, including NS5B thumb 1-, thumb 2-, and palm-domain targeting drugs, was not antagonistic.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Resistance to simeprevir was characterized in HCV genotype 1a and 1b replicon-containing cells. Ninety-six percent (96%) of simeprevir-selected genotype 1 replicons carried one or multiple amino acid substitutions at NS3 protease positions F43, Q80, R155, A156, and/or D168, with substitutions at NS3 position D168 being most frequently observed (78%). Additionally, resistance to simeprevir was evaluated in HCV genotype 1a and 1b replicon assays using site-directed mutants and chimeric replicons carrying NS3 sequences derived from clinical isolates. Amino acid substitutions at NS3 positions F43, Q80, S122, R155, A156, and D168 reduced susceptibility to simeprevir. Replicons with D168V or A, and R155K substitutions displayed large reductions in susceptibility to simeprevir (FC in EC<sub>50 </sub>value greater than 50), whereas other substitutions such as Q80K or R, S122R, and D168E displayed lower reductions in susceptibility (FC in EC<sub>50</sub> value between 2 and 50). Other substitutions such as Q80G or L, S122G, N or T did not reduce susceptibility to simeprevir in the replicon assay (FC in EC<sub>50</sub> value lower than 2). Amino acid substitutions at NS3 positions Q80, S122, R155, and/or D168 that were associated with lower reductions in susceptibility to simeprevir when occurring alone, reduced susceptibility to simeprevir by more than 50-fold when present in combination.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>In a pooled analysis of subjects treated with 150 mg OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV who did not achieve SVR in the controlled Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, emerging virus with amino acid substitutions at NS3 positions Q80, S122, R155 and/or D168 were observed in 180 out of 197 (91%) subjects. Substitutions D168V and R155K alone or in combination with other substitutions at these positions emerged most frequently (Table 9). Most of these emerging substitutions have been shown to reduce susceptibility to simeprevir in cell culture replicon assays.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>HCV genotype 1 subtype-specific patterns of simeprevir treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions were observed. HCV genotype 1a predominately had emerging R155K alone or in combination with amino acid substitutions at NS3 positions Q80, S122 and/or D168, while HCV genotype 1b had most often an emerging D168V substitution (Table 9). In HCV genotype 1a with a baseline Q80K amino acid polymorphism, an emerging R155K substitution was observed most frequently at failure.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The persistence of simeprevir-resistant virus was assessed following treatment failure in the pooled analysis of subjects receiving 150 mg OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV in the controlled Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials. The proportion of subjects with detectable levels of treatment-emergent, resistance-associated variants was followed post treatment for a median time of 28 weeks (range 0 to 70 weeks). Resistant variants remained at detectable levels in 32 out of 66 subjects (48%) with single emerging R155K and in 16 out of 48 subjects (33%) with single emerging D168V.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Analyses were conducted to explore the association between naturally-occurring baseline NS3/4A amino acid substitutions (polymorphisms) and treatment outcome. In the pooled analysis of the Phase 3 trials QUEST 1 and QUEST 2, and in the PROMISE trial, the efficacy of OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV was substantially reduced in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1a virus with the NS3 Q80K polymorphism at baseline <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S14.2">Clinical Studies (14.2)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The observed prevalence of NS3 Q80K polymorphic variants at baseline in the overall population of the Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials (PILLAR, ASPIRE, PROMISE, QUEST 1 and QUEST 2) was 14%; while the observed prevalence of the Q80K polymorphism was 30% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1a and 0.5% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1b. The observed prevalence of Q80K polymorphic variants at baseline in the U.S. population of these Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials was 35% overall, 48% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1a and 0% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1b. With the exception of the NS3 Q80K polymorphism, baseline HCV variants with polymorphisms at NS3 positions F43, Q80, S122, R155, A156, and/or D168 that were associated with reduced simeprevir activity in replicon assays were generally uncommon (1.3%) in subjects with HCV genotype 1 infection in these Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials (n=2007).</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Cross-resistance is expected among NS3/4A protease inhibitors. Some of the treatment-emergent virus detected in OLYSIO-treated subjects who did not achieve SVR in clinical trials, including virus expressing R155K, which emerged frequently, and I170T, which emerged infrequently, have been shown to be less susceptible to the NS3/4A protease inhibitors, boceprevir and/or telaprevir.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The most frequently occurring boceprevir or telaprevir treatment-emergent viruses that are expected to impact subsequent treatment with OLYSIO include variants expressing NS3 R155K, A156T, or A156V. Virus expressing the NS3 amino substitutions V36A or G and I170A or T, which displayed slight shifts in susceptibility to simeprevir in replicon cultures, may emerge in patients who do not achieve SVR with boceprevir or telaprevir, and may therefore also impact subsequent treatment with OLYSIO. Failure to achieve SVR with simeprevir does not select virus that is cross-resistant to sofosbuvir or vice versa.</paragraph>

                     <title>14.1   Overview of Clinical Trials</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection was evaluated in two Phase 3 trials in treatment-naïve subjects (trials QUEST 1 and QUEST 2), one Phase 3 trial in subjects who relapsed after prior interferon-based therapy (PROMISE), one Phase 2 trial in subjects who failed prior therapy with Peg-IFN and RBV (including prior relapsers, partial and null responders) (ASPIRE), and one Phase 3 trial in subjects with HCV genotype 1 and HIV-1 co-infection who were HCV treatment-naïve or failed previous HCV therapy with Peg-IFN and RBV (trial C212).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV in patients with HCV genotype 4 infection was evaluated in one Phase 3 trial in treatment-naïve subjects or subjects who failed previous therapy with Peg-IFN and RBV (RESTORE).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Prior relapsers were subjects who had HCV RNA not detected at the end of prior IFN-based therapy and HCV RNA detected during follow-up; prior partial responders were subjects with prior on-treatment greater than or equal to 2 log<sub>10</sub> reduction in HCV RNA from baseline at Week 12 and HCV RNA detected at the end of prior therapy with Peg-IFN and RBV; and null responders were subjects with prior on-treatment less than 2 log<sub>10</sub> reduction in HCV RNA from baseline at Week 12 during prior therapy with Peg-IFN and RBV. Subjects in these trials had compensated liver disease (including cirrhosis), HCV RNA of at least 10000 IU/mL, and liver histopathology consistent with CHC infection. In subjects who were treatment-naïve and prior relapsers, the overall duration of treatment with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV in the Phase 3 trials was response-guided. In these subjects, the planned total duration of HCV treatment was 24 weeks if the following on-treatment protocol-defined response-guided therapy (RGT) criteria were met: HCV RNA lower than 25 IU/mL (detected or not detected) at Week 4 AND HCV RNA not detected at Week 12. Plasma HCV RNA levels were measured using the Roche COBAS<sup>®</sup> TaqMan<sup>®</sup> HCV test (version 2.0), for use with the High Pure System (25 IU/mL lower limit of quantification and 15 IU/mL limit of detection). Treatment stopping rules for HCV therapy were used to ensure that subjects with inadequate on-treatment virologic response discontinued treatment in a timely manner. In the Phase 3 trial C212 in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects, the total duration of treatment with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV in treatment-naïve and prior relapser subjects with cirrhosis was not response-guided; these subjects received a fixed total duration of HCV treatment of 48 weeks. The total duration of treatment with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV in non-cirrhotic HCV/HIV-1 co-infected treatment-naïve or prior relapser subjects was response-guided using the same criteria.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of OLYSIO in combination with sofosbuvir without or with RBV was evaluated in a Phase 2 trial (COSMOS) in HCV genotype 1 infected prior null responders with METAVIR fibrosis score F0–F4 or treatment-naïve subjects with METAVIR fibrosis score F3–F4 and compensated liver disease.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>SVR was defined as HCV RNA not detected 24 weeks after planned end of treatment (SVR24) in the ASPIRE trial and was defined as HCV RNA lower than 25 IU/mL detected or not detected 12 weeks after the planned end of treatment (SVR12) in the COSMOS and Phase 3 trials.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The efficacy of OLYSIO in treatment-naïve patients with HCV genotype 1 infection was demonstrated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm, multicenter, Phase 3 trials (QUEST 1 and QUEST 2). The designs of both trials were similar. All subjects received 12 weeks of once daily treatment with 150 mg OLYSIO or placebo, plus Peg-IFN-alfa-2a (QUEST 1 and QUEST 2) or Peg-IFN-alfa-2b (QUEST 2) and RBV, followed by 12 or 36 weeks of therapy with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV in accordance with the on-treatment protocol-defined RGT criteria. Subjects in the control groups received 48 weeks of Peg-IFN-alfa-2a or -2b and RBV.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In the pooled analysis for QUEST 1 and QUEST 2, demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between both trials and between the OLYSIO and placebo treatment groups. In the pooled analysis of trials (QUEST 1 and QUEST 2), the 785 enrolled subjects had a median age of 47 years (range: 18 to 73 years; with 2% above 65 years); 56% were male; 91% were White, 7% Black or African American, 1% Asian, and 17% Hispanic; 23% had a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 78% had HCV RNA levels greater than 800000 IU/mL; 74% had METAVIR fibrosis score F0, F1 or F2, 16% METAVIR fibrosis score F3, and 10% METAVIR fibrosis score F4 (cirrhosis); 48% had HCV genotype 1a, and 51% HCV genotype 1b; 29% had <content styleCode="italics">IL28B </content>CC genotype, 56% <content styleCode="italics">IL28B</content> CT genotype, and 15% <content styleCode="italics">IL28B </content>TT genotype; 17% of the overall population and 34% of the subjects with genotype 1a virus had the NS3 Q80K polymorphism at baseline. In QUEST 1, all subjects received Peg-IFN-alfa-2a; in QUEST 2, 69% of the subjects received Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and 31% received Peg-IFN-alfa-2b.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Table 12 shows the response rates in treatment-naïve adult subjects with HCV genotype 1 infection. In the OLYSIO treatment group, SVR12 rates were lower in subjects with genotype 1a virus with the NS3 Q80K polymorphism at baseline compared to subjects infected with genotype 1a virus without the Q80K polymorphism.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>C212 was an open-label, single-arm Phase 3 trial in HIV-1 subjects co-infected with HCV genotype 1 who were treatment-naïve or failed prior HCV therapy with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV (including prior relapsers, partial responders or null responders). Non-cirrhotic treatment-naïve subjects or prior relapsers received 12 weeks of once-daily treatment with 150 mg OLYSIO plus Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV, followed by 12 or 36 weeks of therapy with Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV in accordance with the protocol-defined RGT criteria. Prior non-responder subjects (partial and null response) and all cirrhotic subjects (METAVIR fibrosis score F4) received 36 weeks of Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV after the initial 12 weeks of OLYSIO in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The 106 enrolled subjects in the C212 trial had a median age of 48 years (range: 27 to 67 years; with 2% above 65 years); 85% were male; 82% were White, 14% Black or African American, 1% Asian, and 6% Hispanic; 12% had a BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 86% had HCV RNA levels greater than 800,000 IU/mL; 68% had METAVIR fibrosis score F0, F1 or F2, 19% METAVIR fibrosis score F3, and 13% METAVIR fibrosis score F4; 82% had HCV genotype 1a, and 17% HCV genotype 1b; 28% of the overall population and 34% of the subjects with genotype 1a had Q80K polymorphism at baseline; 27% had <content styleCode="italics">IL28B</content> CC genotype, 56% <content styleCode="italics">IL28B</content> CT genotype, and 17% <content styleCode="italics">IL28B</content> TT genotype; 50% (n=53) were HCV treatment-naïve subjects, 14% (n=15) prior relapsers, 9% (n=10) prior partial responders, and 26% (n=28) prior null responders. Eighty-eight percent (n=93) of the subjects were on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and the integrase inhibitor raltegravir being the most commonly used HIV antiretroviral. HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (except rilpivirine) were prohibited from use in this study.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The median baseline HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4+ cell count in subjects not on HAART were 4.18 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL (range: 1.3–4.9 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL) and 677 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/L (range: 489–1076 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/L), respectively. The median baseline CD4+ cell count in subjects on HAART was 561 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL (range: 275–1407 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL).</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>RESTORE was an open-label, single-arm Phase 3 trial in subjects with HCV genotype 4 infection who were treatment-naïve or failed prior therapy with Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV (including prior relapsers, partial responders or null responders). Treatment-naïve subjects or prior relapsers received once-daily treatment with 150 mg OLYSIO plus Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV for 12 weeks, followed by 12 or 36 weeks of therapy with Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV in accordance with the protocol-defined RGT criteria. Prior non-responder subjects (partial and null response) received once-daily treatment with 150 mg OLYSIO plus Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV for 12 weeks, followed by 36 weeks of Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The 107 enrolled subjects in the RESTORE trial with HCV genotype 4 had a median age of 49 years (range: 27 to 69 years; with 5% above 65 years); 79% were male; 72% were White, 28% Black or African American, and 7% Hispanic; 14% had a BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 60% had HCV RNA levels greater than 800,000 IU/mL; 57% had METAVIR fibrosis score F0, F1 or F2, 14% METAVIR fibrosis score F3, and 29% METAVIR fibrosis score F4; 42% had HCV genotype 4a, and 24% had HCV genotype 4d; 8% had <content styleCode="italics">IL28B</content> CC genotype, 58% <content styleCode="italics">IL28B</content> CT genotype, and 35% <content styleCode="italics">IL28B</content> TT genotype; 33% (n=35) were treatment-naïve HCV subjects, 21% (n=22) prior relapsers, 9% (n=10) prior partial responders, and 37% (n=40) prior null responders.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Table 19 shows the response rates in treatment-naïve, prior relapsers, prior partial responders and null responders. Table 20 shows the SVR rates by METAVIR fibrosis scores.</paragraph>

All subjects were prior null responders to Peg-IFN-alfa and RBV.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The 87 enrolled subjects with advanced hepatic fibrosis in Cohort 2 had a median age of 58 years (range 28 to 70 years; with 3% above 65 years); 67% were male; 91% were White, 9% Black or African American, and 17% were Hispanic; 44% had a BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 84% had HCV RNA levels greater than 800,000 IU/mL; 53% had METAVIR fibrosis score F3 and 47% had METAVIR fibrosis score F4 (cirrhosis); 78% had HCV genotype 1a, and 22% HCV genotype 1b; 31% of the overall population and 40% of the subjects with genotype 1a had the NS3 Q80K polymorphism at baseline; 21% had <content styleCode="italics">IL28B </content>CC genotype, 56% <content styleCode="italics">IL28B </content>CT genotype, and 23% <content styleCode="italics">IL28B </content>TT genotype.

                              <paragraph>Table 21 shows the response rates by combining prior null responders in Cohort 1 and treatment-naïve subjects and prior null responders in Cohort 2. When treatment arms with and without ribavirin were combined, the overall SVR12 rate was 95% (61/64) in subjects with METAVIR fibrosis score F0-F3 who received 12 weeks treatment of OLYSIO in combination with sofosbuvir with/without RBV when pooling both cohorts. The overall SVR12 rate was 96% (22/23) in subjects with METAVIR fibrosis score F4 who received 24 weeks treatment of OLYSIO in combination with sofosbuvir with/without RBV when pooling both cohorts.  Addition of RBV did not increase response rates in comparison with OLYSIO in combination with sofosbuvir alone; and therefore these data are not shown in Table 21.</paragraph>
