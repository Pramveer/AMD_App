                        <p>									Anemia has been reported with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin therapy. The addition of VICTRELIS to peginterferon alfa and ribavirin is associated with an additional decrease in hemoglobin concentrations. Complete blood counts (with white blood cell differential counts) should be obtained pretreatment, and at Treatment Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, and should be monitored closely at other time points, as clinically appropriate. If hemoglobin is less than 10 g per dL, a decrease in dosage of ribavirin is recommended; and if hemoglobin is less than 8.5 g per dL, discontinuation of ribavirin is recommended <content stylecode="italics">[see <a href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</a> and <a href="#S14">Clinical Studies (14)</a>]</content>. If ribavirin is permanently discontinued for management of anemia, then peginterferon alfa and VICTRELIS must also be discontinued <content stylecode="italics">[see <a href="#S2.3">Dosage and Administration (2.3)</a>]</content>. 								</p>
                        <p>Refer to the prescribing information for ribavirin for additional information regarding dose reduction and/or discontinuation.</p>
                        <p>In clinical trials with VICTRELIS, the proportion of subjects who experienced hemoglobin values less than 10 g per dL and less than 8.5 g per dL was higher in subjects treated with the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron<sup>®</sup>/REBETOL<sup>®</sup> than in those treated with PegIntron/REBETOL alone (see <a href="#t4">Table 4</a>). With the interventions used for anemia management in the clinical trials, the average additional decrease of hemoglobin was approximately 1 g per dL.</p>
                        <p>In clinical trials, the median time to onset of hemoglobin less than 10 g per dL from the initiation of therapy was similar among subjects treated with the combination of VICTRELIS and PegIntron/REBETOL (71 days with a range of 15-337 days), compared to those who received PegIntron/REBETOL (71 days with a range of 8-337 days). Certain adverse reactions consistent with symptoms of anemia, such as dyspnea, exertional dyspnea, dizziness and syncope were reported more frequently in subjects who received the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron/REBETOL than in those treated with PegIntron/REBETOL alone <content stylecode="italics">[see <a href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</a>].</content>
                        </p>
                        <p>In clinical trials with VICTRELIS, dose modifications (generally of PegIntron/REBETOL) due to anemia occurred twice as often in subjects treated with the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron/REBETOL (26%) compared to PegIntron/REBETOL (13%). The proportion of subjects who discontinued study drug due to anemia was 1% in subjects treated with the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron/REBETOL and 1% in subjects who received PegIntron/REBETOL. The use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) was permitted for management of anemia, at the investigator's discretion, with or without ribavirin dose reduction in the Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. The proportion of subjects who received an ESA was 43% in those treated with the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron/REBETOL compared to 24% in those treated with PegIntron/REBETOL alone. The proportion of subjects who received a transfusion for the management of anemia was 3% of subjects treated with the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron/REBETOL compared to less than 1% in subjects who received PegIntron/REBETOL alone.</p>
                        <p>Thromboembolic events have been associated with ESA use in other disease states; and have also been reported with peginterferon alfa use in hepatitis C patients. Thromboembolic events were reported in clinical trials with VICTRELIS among subjects receiving the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron/REBETOL, and among those receiving PegIntron/REBETOL alone, regardless of ESA use. No definite causality assessment or benefit risk assessment could be made for these events due to the presence of confounding factors and lack of randomization of ESA use.</p>
                        <p>A randomized, parallel-arm, open-label clinical trial was conducted in previously untreated CHC subjects with genotype 1 infection to compare use of an ESA versus ribavirin dose reduction for initial management of anemia during therapy with VICTRELIS in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin. Similar SVR rates were reported in subjects who were randomized to receive ribavirin dose reduction compared to subjects who were randomized to receive an ESA. In this trial, use of ESAs was associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and deep vein thrombosis compared to ribavirin dose reduction alone. The treatment discontinuation rate due to anemia was similar in subjects randomized to receive ribavirin dose reduction compared to subjects randomized to receive ESA (2% in each group). The transfusion rate was 4% in subjects randomized to receive ribavirin dose reduction and 2% in subjects randomized to receive ESA.</p>
                        <p>Ribavirin dose reduction is recommended for the initial management of anemia.</p>

                        <p>									In Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, seven percent of subjects receiving the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron/REBETOL had neutrophil counts of less than 0.5 × 10<sup>9</sup> per L compared to 4% of subjects receiving PegIntron/REBETOL alone (see <a href="#t4">Table 4</a>). Three subjects experienced severe or life-threatening infections associated with neutropenia, and two subjects experienced life-threatening neutropenia while receiving the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron/REBETOL. Complete blood counts (with white blood cell differential counts) should be obtained at pretreatment, and at Treatment Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, and should be monitored closely at other time points, as clinically appropriate. Decreases in neutrophil counts may require dose reduction or discontinuation of peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.

The assay should have a lower limit of HCV-RNA quantification of equal to or less than 25 IU per mL, and a limit of HCV-RNA detection of approximately 10 to 15 IU per mL. For the purposes of assessing Response-Guided Therapy milestones, a confirmed "detectable but below limit of quantification" HCV-RNA result should not be considered equivalent to an "undetectable" HCV-RNA result (reported as "Target Not Detected" or "HCV-RNA Not Detected").</p>
                        <p>									Complete blood count (with white blood cell differential counts) should be obtained at pretreatment, and at Treatment Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, and should be monitored closely at other time points, as clinically appropriate. 								</p>

                        <p>The most commonly reported adverse reactions (more than 35% of subjects regardless of investigator's causality assessment) in adult subjects were fatigue, anemia, nausea, headache, and dysgeusia when VICTRELIS was used in combination with PegIntron and REBETOL.</p>
                        <p>The safety of the combination of VICTRELIS 800 mg three times daily with PegIntron/REBETOL was assessed in 2095 subjects with chronic hepatitis C in one Phase 2, open-label trial and two Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials. SPRINT-1 (subjects who were previously untreated) evaluated the use of VICTRELIS in combination with PegIntron/REBETOL with or without a four-week lead-in period with PegIntron/REBETOL compared to PegIntron/REBETOL alone. SPRINT-2 (subjects who were previously untreated) and RESPOND-2 (subjects who had failed previous therapy) evaluated the use of VICTRELIS 800 mg three times daily in combination with PegIntron/REBETOL with a four-week lead-in period with PegIntron/REBETOL compared to PegIntron/REBETOL alone <content stylecode="italics">[see <a href="#S14">Clinical Studies (14)</a>]</content>. The population studied had a mean age of 49 years (3% of subjects were older than 65 years of age), 39% were female, 82% were white and 15% were black.</p>
                        <p>During the four week lead-in period with PegIntron/REBETOL in subjects treated with the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron/REBETOL, 28/1263 (2%) subjects experienced adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of treatment. During the entire course of treatment, the proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 13% for subjects receiving the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron/REBETOL and 12% for subjects receiving PegIntron/REBETOL alone. Events resulting in discontinuation were similar to those seen in previous studies with PegIntron/REBETOL. Only anemia and fatigue were reported as events that led to discontinuation in more than 1% of subjects in any arm.</p>
                        <p>Adverse reactions that led to dose modifications of any drug (primarily PegIntron and REBETOL) occurred in 39% of subjects receiving the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron/REBETOL compared to 24% of subjects receiving PegIntron/REBETOL alone. The most common reason for dose reduction was anemia, which occurred more frequently in subjects receiving the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron/REBETOL than in subjects receiving PegIntron/REBETOL alone.</p>
                        <p>Serious adverse events were reported in 11% of subjects receiving the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron/REBETOL and in 8% of subjects receiving PegIntron/REBETOL.</p>
                        <p>Adverse events (regardless of investigator's causality assessment) reported in greater than or equal to 10% of subjects receiving the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron/REBETOL and reported at a rate of greater than or equal to 5% than PegIntron/REBETOL alone in SPRINT-1, SPRINT-2, and RESPOND-2 are presented in <a href="#t3">Table 3</a>.</p>

                              </p>
                              <p>The effect of boceprevir 800 mg and 1200 mg on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, multiple-dose, placebo-, and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) 4-way crossover thorough QT study in 36 healthy subjects. In the study with demonstrated ability to detect small effects, the upper bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc based on individual correction method (QTcI) was below 10 ms, the threshold for regulatory concern. The dose of 1200 mg yields a boceprevir maximum exposure increase of approximately 15% which may not cover exposures due to coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or use in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  However, at the doses studied in the thorough QT study, no apparent concentration-QT relationship was identified. Thus, there is no expectation of a QTc effect under a higher exposure scenario.</p>

                        <p>VICTRELIS capsules contain a 1:1 mixture of two diastereomers, SCH534128 and SCH534129. In plasma the diastereomer ratio changes to 2:1, favoring the active diastereomer, SCH534128. Plasma concentrations of boceprevir described below consist of both diastereomers SCH534128 and SCH534129, unless otherwise specified.</p>
                        <p>In healthy subjects who received 800 mg three times daily alone, boceprevir drug exposure was characterized by AUC(т) of 5408 ng × hr per mL (n=71), C<sub>max</sub> of 1723 ng per mL (n=71), and C<sub>min</sub> of 88 ng per mL (n=71). Pharmacokinetic results were similar between healthy subjects and HCV-infected subjects.</p>

                              <p>Boceprevir was absorbed following oral administration with a median T<sub>max</sub> of 2 hours. Steady state AUC, C<sub>max</sub>, and C<sub>min</sub> increased in a less-than-dose-proportional manner and individual exposures overlapped substantially at 800 mg and 1200 mg, suggesting diminished absorption at higher doses. Accumulation is minimal (0.8- to 1.5-fold) and pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved after approximately 1 day of three times daily dosing.</p>
                              <p>The absolute bioavailability of boceprevir has not been studied.</p>

                              <p>Boceprevir has a mean apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of approximately 772 L at steady state in healthy subjects. Human plasma protein binding is approximately 75% following a single dose of boceprevir 800 mg. Boceprevir is administered as an approximately equal mixture of two diastereomers, SCH534128 and SCH534129, which rapidly interconvert in plasma. The predominant diastereomer, SCH534128, is pharmacologically active and the other diastereomer is inactive.</p>

                              <p>Studies <content stylecode="italics">in vitro</content> indicate that boceprevir primarily undergoes metabolism through the aldo-keto reductase (AKR)-mediated pathway to ketone-reduced metabolites that are inactive against HCV. After a single 800-mg oral dose of <sup>14</sup>C-boceprevir, the most abundant circulating metabolites were a diastereomeric mixture of ketone-reduced metabolites with a mean exposure approximately 4-fold greater than that of boceprevir. Boceprevir also undergoes, to a lesser extent, oxidative metabolism mediated by CYP3A4/5.</p>

                              <p>Boceprevir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS3/4A protease that is necessary for the proteolytic cleavage of the HCV encoded polyprotein into mature forms of the NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B proteins. Boceprevir covalently, yet reversibly, binds to the NS3 protease active site serine (S139) through an (alpha)-ketoamide functional group to inhibit viral replication in HCV-infected host cells. In a biochemical assay, boceprevir inhibited the activity of recombinant HCV genotype 1a and 1b NS3/4A protease enzymes, with K<sub>i</sub> values of 14 nM for each subtype.</p>

                              <p>The EC<sub>50</sub> and EC<sub>90</sub> values for boceprevir against an HCV replicon constructed from a single genotype 1b isolate were approximately 200 nM and 400 nM, respectively, in a 72-hour cell culture assay. Boceprevir cell culture anti-HCV activity was approximately 2-fold lower for an HCV replicon derived from a single genotype 1a isolate, relative to the 1b isolate-derived replicon. In replicon assays, boceprevir had approximately 2-fold reduced activity against a genotype 2a isolate relative to genotype 1a and 1b replicon isolates. In a biochemical assay, boceprevir had approximately 3- and 2-fold reduced activity against NS3/4A proteases derived from single isolates representative of HCV genotypes 2 and 3a, respectively, relative to a genotype 1b-derived NS3/4A protease. The presence of 50% human serum reduced the cell culture anti-HCV activity of boceprevir by approximately 3-fold.</p>
                              <p>Evaluation of varying combinations of boceprevir and interferon alfa-2b that produced 90% suppression of replicon RNA in cell culture showed additivity of effect without evidence of antagonism.</p>

                              </p>
                              <p>Data from an ongoing, long-term follow-up study of subjects who did not achieve SVR in Phase 2 trials with VICTRELIS, with a median duration of follow-up of approximately 2 years, indicate that HCV populations harboring certain post-baseline,  treatment-emergent substitutions may decline in relative abundance over time. However, among those subjects with available data, one or more treatment-emergent substitutions remained detectable with a population-based sequencing assay in 25% of subjects after 2.5 years of follow-up. The most common NS3 substitutions detected after 2.5 years of follow-up were T54S and R155K. The lack of detection of a substitution based on a population-based assay does not necessarily indicate that viral populations carrying that substitution have declined to a background level that may have existed prior to treatment. The long-term clinical impact of the emergence or persistence of boceprevir-resistance-associated substitutions is unknown. No data are available regarding the efficacy of VICTRELIS among subjects who were previously exposed to VICTRELIS, or who previously failed treatment with a regimen containing VICTRELIS.</p>

                              <p>A pooled analysis was conducted to explore the association between the detection of baseline NS3/4A amino acid polymorphisms and treatment outcome in the two Phase 3 studies, SPRINT-2 and RESPOND-2.</p>
                              <p>Baseline resistance associated polymorphisms were detected in 7% of subjects by a population-based sequencing method. Overall, the presence of these polymorphisms alone did not impact SVR rates in subjects treated with VICTRELIS. However, among subjects with a relatively poor response to PegIntron/REBETOL during the 4-week lead-in period, the efficacy of VICTRELIS appeared to be reduced for those who had V36M, T54A, T54S, V55A or R155K detected at baseline. Subjects with these baseline polymorphisms and reduced response to PegIntron/REBETOL represented approximately 1% of the total number of subjects treated with VICTRELIS.</p>

                              <p>Many of the treatment-emergent NS3 amino acid substitutions detected in subjects treated with VICTRELIS who did not achieve SVR in the Phase 3 clinical trials have been demonstrated to reduce the anti-HCV activity of other HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors. The impact of prior exposure to VICTRELIS or treatment failure on the efficacy of other HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors has not been studied. The efficacy of VICTRELIS has not been established for patients with a history of exposure to other NS3/4A protease inhibitors. Cross-resistance is not expected between VICTRELIS and interferons, or VICTRELIS and ribavirin.</p>

Among previous treatment failures, subjects of all genotypes appeared to have higher SVR rates with regimens containing VICTRELIS. The results of this retrospective subgroup analysis should be viewed with caution because of the small sample size and potential differences in demographic or clinical characteristics of the substudy population relative to the overall trial population.</p>

At this dose, boceprevir AUC exposures are approximately 1.3-fold higher than those in humans at the recommended dose of 800 mg three times daily. Decreased fertility was also observed in male rats, most likely as a consequence of testicular degeneration. No testicular degeneration was observed at a 15 mg per kg dose level resulting in boceprevir AUC exposures of less than those in humans at the recommended dose of 800 mg three times daily. Testicular degeneration was not observed in mice or monkeys administered boceprevir for 3 months at doses of up to 900 or 1000 mg per kg, respectively. At these doses, boceprevir AUC exposures are approximately 6.8- and 4.4-fold higher in mice and monkeys, respectively, than those in humans at the recommended dose of 800 mg three times daily. Additionally, limited clinical monitoring has revealed no evidence of testicular toxicity in human subjects.</p>

                        <p>SPRINT-2 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing two therapeutic regimens of VICTRELIS 800 mg orally three times daily in combination with PR [PegIntron 1.5 micrograms per kg per week subcutaneously and weight-based dosing with REBETOL (600–1400 mg per day orally divided twice daily)] to PR alone in adult subjects who had chronic hepatitis C (HCV genotype 1) infection with detectable levels of HCV-RNA and were not previously treated with interferon alfa therapy. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio within two separate cohorts (Cohort 1/non-Black and Cohort 2/Black) and were stratified by HCV genotype (1a or 1b) and by HCV-RNA viral load (less than or equal to 400,000 IU per mL vs. more than 400,000 IU per mL) to one of the following three treatment arms:</p>

                           <li>PegIntron + REBETOL for 48 weeks (PR48).</li>
                           <li>PegIntron + REBETOL for four weeks followed by VICTRELIS 800 mg three times daily + PegIntron + REBETOL for 24 weeks. The subjects were then continued on different regimens based on Treatment Week (TW) 8 through TW24 response-guided therapy (boceprevir-RGT). All subjects in this treatment arm were limited to 24 weeks of therapy with VICTRELIS. 						<ul ultype="unordered" stylecode="circle">
                                 <li>Subjects with undetectable HCV-RNA (Target Not Detected) at TW8 (early responders) and remained undetectable through TW24 discontinued therapy and entered follow-up at the TW28 visit.</li>
                                 <li>Subjects with detectable HCV-RNA at TW8 or any subsequent treatment week but subsequently achieving undetectable HCV-RNA (Target Not Detected) at TW24 (late responders) were changed in a blinded fashion to placebo at the TW28 visit and continued therapy with PegIntron + REBETOL for an additional 20 weeks, for a total treatment duration of 48 weeks.</li>
                              </ul>

                        <p>All subjects with detectable HCV-RNA in plasma at TW24 were discontinued from treatment. Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) was defined as plasma HCV-RNA less than 25 IU/mL at Follow-up Week 24. Plasma HCV-RNA results at Follow-up Week 12 were used if plasma HCV-RNA results at Follow-up Week 24 were missing.</p>
                        <p>Mean age of subjects randomized was 49 years. The racial distribution of subjects was as follows: 82% White, 14% Black, and 4% others. The distribution of subjects by gender was 60% men and 40% women.</p>
                        <p>The addition of VICTRELIS to PegIntron and REBETOL significantly increased the SVR rates compared to PegIntron and REBETOL alone in the combined cohort (63% to 66% in arms containing VICTRELIS vs. 38% PR48 control) for randomized subjects who received at least one dose of any study medication (Full-Analysis-Set population). SVR rates for Blacks who received the combination of VICTRELIS with PegIntron and REBETOL were 42% to 53% in a predefined analysis (see <a href="#t10">Table 10</a>).</p>

                        <p>RESPOND-2 was a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind study comparing two therapeutic regimens of VICTRELIS 800 mg orally three times daily in combination with PR [PegIntron 1.5 micrograms per kg per week subcutaneously and weight-based ribavirin (600–1400 mg per day orally divided twice daily)] compared to PR alone in adult subjects with chronic hepatitis C (HCV genotype 1) infection with demonstrated interferon responsiveness (as defined historically by a decrease in HCV-RNA viral load greater than or equal to 2-log<sub>10</sub> by Week 12, but never achieved SVR [partial responders] or undetectable HCV-RNA at end of prior treatment with a subsequent detectable HCV-RNA in plasma [relapsers]). Subjects with less than 2-log<sub>10</sub> decrease in HCV-RNA by week 12 of previous treatment (prior null responders) were not eligible for enrollment in this trial. Subjects were randomized in a 1:2:2 ratio and stratified based on response to their previous qualifying regimen (relapsers vs. partial responders) and by HCV subtype (1a vs. 1b) to one of the following treatment arms:</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>A randomized, parallel-arm, open-label study was conducted to compare two strategies for the management of anemia (use of ESA versus ribavirin dose reduction) in 687 subjects with previously untreated CHC genotype 1 infection who became anemic during therapy with VICTRELIS 800 mg orally three times daily plus peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 micrograms per kg per week subcutaneously and weight-based ribavirin (600 – 1,400 mg orally per day divided twice daily). The study enrolled subjects with serum hemoglobin concentrations of less than 15 g per dL. Subjects were treated for 4 weeks with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin followed by up to 44 weeks of VICTRELIS plus peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin. If a subject became anemic (serum hemoglobin of approximately less than or equal to 10 g per dL within the treatment period), the subject was randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either ribavirin dose reduction (N=249) or use of erythropoietin 40,000 units subcutaneously once weekly for the management of the anemia (N=251). If serum hemoglobin concentrations continued to decrease to less than or equal to 8.5 g per dL, subjects could be treated with additional anemia interventions, including the addition of erythropoietin (18% of those in the ribavirin dose reduction arm) or ribavirin dose reduction (37% of those in the ESA arm).</p>
                        <p>Mean age of subjects randomized was 49 years. The racial distribution of subjects was as follows: 77% White, 19% Black, and 4% other. The distribution of subjects by gender was 37% men and 63% women.  </p>
                        <p>The overall intent-to-treat SVR rate for all enrolled subjects (including those subjects who were not randomized to RBV dose reduction or ESA for the management of anemia) was 63% (431/687). The SVR rate in subjects randomized who received ribavirin dose reduction was 71% (178/249), similar to the SVR rate of 71% (178/251) in subjects randomized to receive an ESA. The relapse rates in subjects randomized to receive ribavirin dose reduction or an ESA were 10% (19/196) and 10% (19/197), respectively.</p>
