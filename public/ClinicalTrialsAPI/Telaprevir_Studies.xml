      <outcome_measure>The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of administration of TVR 750 mg every 8 hours and 1875 mg every 8 hours, both at steady-state, versus placebo on the QT and QTc interval (heart activity) in healthy volunteers.</outcome_measure>
      <outcome_measure>Trial sensitivity will be evaluated (i.e., the effect of a positive control, a single 400 mg dose of moxifloxacin, on the QT/QTc interval).</outcome_measure>
      <outcome_measure>The effect of 2 different regimens of TVR on non-QT interval electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters (RR interval, HR, PR interval, and QRS interval) will be evaluated.</outcome_measure>
      <outcome_measure>The pharmacokinetics of 2 dose regimens of TVR, 750 mg every 8 hours and 1875 mg every 8 hours, at steady-state will be evaluated.</outcome_measure>
      <outcome_measure>The concentration-effect relationship for QT/QTc for TVR will be explored.</outcome_measure>
      <outcome_measure>The short-term safety and tolerability of 2 dose regimens of TVR, 750 mg and 1875 mg every 8 hours will be evaluated.</outcome_measure>
