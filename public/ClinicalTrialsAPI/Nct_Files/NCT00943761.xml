      This study will provide vaniprevir 600 mg or 300 mg twice daily in combination with
      pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) to participants with chronic hepatitis C
      virus (HCV) infection who did not achieve viral eradication while participating in a prior
      vaniprevir clinical trial (MK-7009-004, NCT00518622; MK-7009-007, NCT00704405; MK-7009-009,
      NCT00704184; and MK-7009-029, NCT00954993).

    <description>Serious adverse event is defined as any adverse drug or biologic or device experience occurring at any dose resulting in death, was life-threatening, was persistent or caused significant disability/incapacity, required in-patient hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization, was a congenital anomaly or birth defect, was a cancer, or was an overdose.</description>

    <description>SVR24 is defined as undetectable hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) 24 weeks after the end of vaniprevir study therapy. HCV RNA plasma levels were assessed using the Roche COBAS Taqman assay (or equivalent) with the limit of quantification (LoQ) of at least 25 IU/mL and the limit of detection (LoD) of at least 10 IU/mL.</description>
