      Hypothesis: A regimen of low dose of peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin may be as
      effective as currently recommended regimen for chronic hepatitis C in HIV-coinfected
      patients.

      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of lower dose of pegylated interferon-α 2a (135 µg
      weekly) plus ribavirin and a shorter duration of treatment (20 weeks after achieving an
      undetectable plasmatic HCV-RNA)than the current recommended in patients with chronic
      hepatitis or compensated cirrhosis by hepatitis C virus, genotypes 2 or 3, in HIV-coinfected
      patients in real use conditions.

      Method: Phase IV, postautorization, open labelled multicenter trial with a planned duration
      of 118 weeks in which 71 patients from several hospitals of the Servicio Andaluz de Salud
      will be enrolled. The usual clinical and analytical follow up will be performed but
      additional blood samples will be obtained for determination of interferon and ribavirin
      plasma levels. The primary end point wall be a sustained virologic response (defined as an
      undetectable serum HCV-RNA after 24 weeks after the cessation of treatment). Likewise, rapid
      virological response (at 4 weeks of treatment), early virological response (at 12 weeks),
      and end of treatment response rates will be evaluated as well as their relationships with
      the plasma interferon an ribavirin concentrations determined by ELISA and HPLC,
      respectively. The safety and tolerability of the studied medications will be evaluated by
      means of clinical adverse events, physical examination and laboratory results.

    <description>All patients will be treated with the combination of pegIFN-α 2a (135 μg per week)plus oral Ribavirin at a dose of 800 mg per day. The treatment will be continued up to 20 weeks after reaching an undetectable plasma RNA-HCV. Treatment will be discontinued for patients who did not achieve a reduction of al least 2 log10 IU/ml in plasma HCV RNA levels with respect to baseline at week 12 and will be considered as viral failures.</description>
