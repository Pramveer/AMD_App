  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antiviral efficacy of
      ledipasvir/sofosbuvir fixed dose combination (FDC) with or without ribavirin (RBV)
      administered for 12 or 24 weeks in treatment-experienced subjects with chronic genotype 1
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

    <description>Virologic failure was defined as on-treatment virologic failure or virologic relapse.
On-Treatment Virologic Failure was defined as
Breakthrough (confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after having previously had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ while on treatment), or
Rebound (confirmed &gt; 1 log10 IU/mL increase in HCV RNA from nadir while on treatment), or
Non-response (HCV RNA persistently ≥ LLOQ through 8 weeks of treatment)
Virologic relapse was defined as confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ during the posttreatment period having achieved HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at last on-treatment visit.</description>
