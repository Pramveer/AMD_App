    <textblock>
      Study P02538 Part 2 is a 5-year long term follow-up (LTFU) study in pediatric participants
      who were treated with at least one dose of peginterferon alfa-2b (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin
      (RBV) and who completed the follow-up in the P02538 Part 1 study (NCT00104052). No study
      drug therapy will be administered during the P02538 Part 2 study. Durability of virologic
      response will be assessed for participants who attained sustained virologic response (SVR)
      in Part I of this study by performing annual Hepatitis C Virus ribonucleic acid (HCV-RNA)
      testing. In addition, this study will characterize long-term safety in all participants who
      received PEG-IFN plus RBV treatment.

      During the Part 2 LTFU, participants will be evaluated at Years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Each
      participant's first LTFU visit will be scheduled approximately 1 year after the
      post-treatment Follow-up Week 24 visit in Part 1 of this study (NCT00104052).

    <description>The Tanner Stage (TS) defines physical measurements of sexual development based on external primary and secondary sex characteristics. Female participants are evaluated for breast development and pubic hair distribution and male participants are evaluated for genital development and pubic hair distribution, based on a 5-stage ordinal scale ranging from TS 1 (prepubertal/preadolescent characteristics) to TS 5 (mature or adult characteristics). Mean ages for attaining each TS in the normal population have been previously established based on measuring correlating reproductive hormone levels, and are expressed in years as follows for females (F) and males (M): TS 1= 7.1 (F+M); TS 2= 10.5 (F), 12.1 (M); TS 3= 11.6 (F), 13.6 (M); TS 4=, 12.3 (F), 15.1 (M); TS 5= 14.5 (F), 18 (M). To assess sexual maturation at the end of the LTFU (last observation), females and males were staged and the mean age at each TS attained was reported.</description>

             written assent.

          -  The participant must have received at least one dose of peginterferon alfa-2b and
             ribavirin in the Protocol No. P02538 study.

          -  The participant must have completed the 24-week post-treatment follow-up in the
             P02538 Part 1 study. All participants whether sustained responders, relapsers, or
             nonresponders are eligible to participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent participation in any other clinical study.

          -  Retreatment with any antiviral or immunomodulatory drug for chronic hepatitis C after
             completion of, or discontinuation from, the treatment phase of the P02538 Part 1
             study.

          -  Any condition that in the opinion of the Investigator would make the participant
             unsuitable for enrollment.
