  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of a 12- or 24-week treatment regimen
      of simeprevir in combination with daclatasvir, as measured by sustain virologic response 12
      (SVR12), in treatment-naive, chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b-infected
      participants who have advanced fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis (METAVIR F3/F4).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know which treatment the participants receive) study to
      investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of simeprevir and daclatasvir in chronic
      Hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) C virus (HCV) genotype 1b infected participants who
      are treatment-naive. The total study duration for each participant will be approximately 40
      weeks or approximately 52 weeks. The study will consist of 4 parts: Screening Phase
      (approximately 4 weeks) and open-label treatment Phase (12 weeks), optional open label
      treatment phase extension (12 Weeks) and follow-up Phase (up to Week 40 or Week 52).
      Participants will receive simeprevir (150 milligram [mg] capsule) and daclatasvir (60 mg
      tablet) orally once daily for 12 or 24 weeks. Efficacy will be primarily evaluated by
      percentage of participants with SVR12. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must have chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b infection confirmed
             at Screening

          -  Participant must have HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) greater than (&gt;) 10,000
             international unit per milliliter (IU/mL) at Screening

          -  Participant must have documented fibrosis stage at Screening (or between Screening
             and Day 1 [baseline]). Liver disease will be staged based on one of the following
             methods. a) Shear wave elastography (Fibroscan) within less than or equal to (&lt;=) 6
             months before Screening or between Screening and Day 1 (baseline). METAVIR F3 &gt; 9.6
             Kilopascals (kPa) and the cut-off for cirrhosis is greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 14.6
             kPa. b) A biopsy documenting METAVIR F3-F4. Biopsy performed within the 24 months
             before Screening will be accepted for participants with METAVIR score F3. For
             cirrhotic participants (METAVIR score F4) a biopsy performed at any previous time is
             acceptable

          -  Participants who have cirrhosis must have an hepatic imaging procedure (ultrasound,
             computed tomography [CT] scan or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) within 6 months
             prior to the Screening visit (or between Screening and Day 1) with no findings
             suspicious for hepatocellular carcinoma

          -  Participant must have a body mass index (BMI) &gt;= 18 Kilogram per meter^2 (kg/m^2)

          -  Participant must be treatment naive (that is, have not received prior treatment for
             HCV with any approved or investigational drug)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has co-infection with HCV of another genotype; a) Participant who has HCV
             genotype 1b has coinfection with HCV of a genotype other than genotype 1b

          -  Chronic HCV genotype 1b-infected participant who has the presence of genetic variants
             coding for the NS5A-Y93H and/or L31M/V amino acid substitutions at Screening

          -  Participant has evidence of current or previous episodes of hepatic decompensation
             (including controlled or uncontrolled ascites, bleeding varices or hepatic
             encephalopathy)

          -  Participant has chronic liver disease of a non-HCV etiology (including but not
             limited to hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, alfa 1-antitrypsin deficiency,
             cholangitis, drug- or alcohol-related liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis)

          -  Participant has any other uncontrolled clinically significant disease or clinically
             significant findings during Screening that in the opinion of the investigator could
             compromise the participants' safety or could interfere with the participant
             participating in and completing the study

          -  Participant has coinfection with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus (hepatitis A
             antibody immunoglobulin M [IgM] or hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] positive at
             Screening)

          -  Participant has received a solid organ transplant
