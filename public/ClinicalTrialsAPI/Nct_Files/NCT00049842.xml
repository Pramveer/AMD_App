    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PEG-Intron versus no
      treatment for the prevention of fibrosis progression in adult participants with moderate to
      severe liver fibrosis secondary to chronic hepatitis C, who failed PEG-Intron plus Rebetol
      treatment in protocol P02370 (NCT00039871).

    <description>Definitions:
Fibrosis scoring: F0 (no fibrosis), F1 (stellate enlargement of portal tract without septa formation, F2 (enlargement of portal tract with rare septa formation, F3 (numerous septa without cirrhosis), F4 (cirrhosis).
Improved: Participants whose METAVIR fibrosis score at up to Month-36 decreases by 1 or more units compared to baseline.
No Change: Participants whose METAVIR fibrosis score at up to Month-36 is the same as the baseline score.
Worsened: Participants whose METAVIR fibrosis score at up to Month-36 increases by 1 or more units compared to baseline.</description>

    <description>Activity Scoring: A0 (no histological activity), A1 (minimal activity), A2 (moderate activity), A3 (severe activity), A4 (lobular chronic hepatitis).
Changes in liver inflammation defined as follows:
Improved: Participants whose METAVIR activity score at up to Month-36 decreases by 1 or more units compared to baseline.
No Change: Participants whose METAVIR activity score at up to Month-36 is the same as the baseline score.
Worsened: Participants whose METAVIR activity score at up to Month-36 increases by 1 or more units compared to baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to up to Month-36</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The change of Metavir Fibrosis Score = Metavir Fibrosis Score at up to Month-36 - Metavir Fibrosis Score at Baseline.
Fibrosis scoring: 0 (no fibrosis), 1 (stellate enlargement of portal tract without septa formation, 2 (enlargement of portal tract with rare septa formation, 3 (numerous septa without cirrhosis), 4 (cirrhosis).</description>
