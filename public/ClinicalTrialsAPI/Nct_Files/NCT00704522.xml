    <textblock>
      Patients receiving a patient assistance program during therapy for Hepatitis C will be
      enrolled into this study. All patients will receive PegIntron pen and Rebetol according to
      label and the patient assistance program. This study will be compared to similar studies
      from other clinics using various patient support programs for the purpose of designing
      future comparative phase IV studies.
