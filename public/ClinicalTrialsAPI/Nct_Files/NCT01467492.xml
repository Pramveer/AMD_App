  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of telaprevir in
      combination with pegylated interferon alfa 2a (Peg-IFN-alfa-2a) and ribavirin (RBV) in
      treatment-experienced Black/African American and non-Black/African American participants
      with Genotype 1 Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC), who have not achieved a sustained viral response
      with a prior course of interferon-based therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study of treatment-experienced participants
      with Genotype 1 CHC, who self-identified as Black/African American (Group A) or who did not
      self-identify as Black/African American (Group B). Participants did not achieve a sustained
      virologic response 24 weeks after at least 1 prior course of Peg-IFN-alfa-2a/RBV therapy of
      standard duration, and have 1 of the following viral responses:

        -  Prior relapse: Participant had a documented undetectable hepatitis C virus ribonucleic
           acid (HCV RNA) level at the planned end of treatment of at least 42 weeks duration (HCV
           RNA evaluated anytime between 3 weeks before and 6 weeks after the last dose of Peg
           IFN-alfa-2a or RBV).

        -  Prior null response: Participant had a &lt;2-log10 decrease in HCV RNA at 12 weeks, during
           prior Peg IFN-alfa-2a/RBV treatment, but never achieved undetectable HCV RNA while on
           treatment.

        -  Prior partial response: Participant had a &gt;=2-log10 decrease in HCV RNA at 12 weeks,
           during prior Peg IFN-alfa-2a/RBV treatment, but never achieved undetectable HCV RNA
           while on treatment.

    <description>The plasma HCV RNA level was measured using Roche TaqMan HCV RNA assay. The lower limit of quantification was 25 IU/mL. Virologic breakthrough on treatment was defined as an increase of at least 1 log10 from nadir or confirmed detectable HCV RNA (&gt;=lower limit of quantification) after undetectable HCV RNA (&lt;lower limit of quantification).

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>On treatment virologic failure was defined as meeting any futility rule or completing assigned treatment duration and having detectable HCV RNA at EOT. The plasma HCV RNA level was measured using Roche TaqMan HCV RNA assay. The lower limit of quantification was 25 IU/mL. Futility rules: 1) Virologic breakthrough (at least 1 log10 increase from nadir or confirmed detectable HCV RNA after undetectable HCV RNA) from Day 1 through Week 24 or 48 (depending on treatment duration); 2) HCV RNA &gt;1000 IU/mL during Weeks 4 to 12, inclusive; 3) Detectable HCV RNA after Week 12.

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>AE: any untoward medical occurrence in a participant during the study; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency after the informed consent form is signed. AE includes SAE as well as Non-SAEs. SAE (subset of AE): medical event or condition, which falls into any of the following categories, regardless of its relationship to the study drug: death, life threatening adverse experience, in-patient hospitalization/prolongation of hospitalization, persistent/significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, important medical event.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Sequence analysis of the HCV NS3-4A region was performed to monitor telaprevir-resistant variants. HCV RNA was isolated from the plasma, amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and sequenced (sequencing assay limit of detection HCV RNA &gt;=1000 IU/mL). Results of this outcome measure were to be reported for overall participants instead of by race and by prior response.</description>
