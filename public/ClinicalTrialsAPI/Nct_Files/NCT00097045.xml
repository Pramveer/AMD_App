  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the safety, tolerability and antiviral effects of omega
      interferon administered alone to omega interferon administered with ribavirin in the
      treatment of subjects with chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

             (IU/mL) at least seven days apart within 6 weeks prior to randomization

          -  One alanine aminotransferase level greater than the upper limit of normal between
             three months and twelve months prior to randomization

          -  At least one alanine aminotransferase level greater than the upper limit of normal
             between three months and twelve months prior to randomization

          -  For the duration of treatment with study drug for all subjects and for the duration
             of treatment with study drug plus an additional six months for subjects who take
             ribavirin, attenuation of the potential of the subject to become pregnant, or to
             impregnate a sexual partner, by either:

               1. the use of an approved contraceptive method (e.g., IUD, oral contraceptive, or
                  double-barrier method), or

               2. definitive exclusion by surgery, radiation, menopause or vasectomy

          -  For women of childbearing potential, negative serum Beta HCG pregnancy test within 14
             days prior to randomization

          -  Child-Pugh classification B or C liver disease

          -  Clinically apparent jaundice or a total bilirubin exceeding 2 mg/dL (Subjects with
             Gilbert's Syndrome who meet all other inclusion and exclusion criteria may be
             admitted to the study with a total bilirubin greater than 2 mg/dL)

          -  Hemoglobin &lt;12 g/dL

          -  Abnormal thyroid function (Subjects requiring thyroid replacement and who have
             stable, normal thyroid function may be admitted to the study)

          -  History of significant renal dysfunction

          -  History of significant or unstable cardiac disease

          -  Concurrent alcohol abuse or illicit drug use

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Male partners of women who are pregnant

          -  Prior usage of an interferon

          -  Concurrent usage of any antiviral therapy, including another interferon, during the
             study

             carcinoma)

          -  Known hypersensitivity to interferons or ribavirin or related compounds

          -  A concurrent diagnosis of depression that has not been stable for at least 60 days
             prior to randomization

          -  Usage of an investigational drug within the 30 days prior to randomization; or the
             planned usage of an investigational drug other than omega interferon during the
             course of the current study

          -  Prior randomization to this study

          -  Any condition which, at the discretion of the investigator, would render an
