  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare in healthy volunteers levels of TMC435 in the blood
      circulation after intake of 2 new capsule formulations with the level of TMC435 in the blood
      circulation after intake of the capsule formulation used in the Phase IIb studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), open-label (all people involved know
      the treatment), single dose, crossover (volunteers will receive different treatments
      sequentially during the trial) study in healthy volunteers. The trial will evaluate the
      levels of TMC435 in the blood circulation after a single dose of 150 mg TMC435 administered
      as 3 different capsule formulations following breakfast. There will be a 7-day washout
      period between treatments and a 4-5 week follow-up at the end. Each volunteer will receive
      all three treatments. The main focus of the trial is the pharmacokinetic characteristics
      (how drugs are absorbed in the body, how they are distributed within the body and how they
      are removed from the body over time) of the different formulations. This evaluation requires
      multiple blood samples from Day 1 through 72 hours after dosing. Safety assessments (lab
      work, blood pressure, pulse and electrocardiogram) will follow a different schedule and are
      measured on Day -1 (day prior to taking first dose of drug), Day 1 (without lab work) and
      Day 4 of each treatment period, and 1 and 4-5 weeks after the last treatment. Each volunteer
      will receive 3 treatments, 7 days apart from each other. Each treatment consists of one
      single oral dose of 150 mg TMC435.
