  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-site, open-label trial of the co-administration of a fixed-dose
      combination (FDC) of elbasvir (50 mg)/grazoprevir (100 mg) (EBR/GZR) and 400 mg of
      sofosbuvir (SOF), with and without ribavirin (RBV), in treatment-na誰ve (TN) and
      treatment-experienced (TE) subjects with chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Genotype 3 (GT3)
      infection with compensated cirrhosis.

             to peg-interferon/ribavirin)

          -  is otherwise healthy as determined by medical history, physical examination,
             electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory measurements

          -  has compensated cirrhosis of the liver

          -  is TN or TE (i.e., documented prior virologic failure or intolerance to
             peg-interferon/ribavirin)

          -  is not of reproductive potential, or agrees to not impregnate a partner or become

             other suspected malignancy

          -  is currently or has participated (within past 30 days) in a study with an
             investigational compound

          -  has clinically-relevant drug or alcohol abuse within the past 12 months of screening

          -  is a female and is pregnant or breast-feeding

          -  chronic pulmonary disease

          -  hemoglobinopathy

          -  history of hospitalization within 3 months prior to enrollment

          -  medical or surgical condition that may result in need for hospitalization during the
             course of the study

          -  any condition requiring, or likely to require, chronic systemic administration of
             corticosteroids, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists, or other immunosuppresant
             drugs during the course of the study

          -  any condition, prestudy laboratory or ECG abnormality, or history of any illness,
             which could confound results of the study or pose additional risks in administering
             study drugs in the opinion of the investigator

          -  has a life-threatening serious AE (SAE) during the screening period

          -  has evidence of history of chronic hepatitis not caused by HCV
