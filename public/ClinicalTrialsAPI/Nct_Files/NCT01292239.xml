      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TMC435 compared with
      placebo in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a (pegIFN alfa-2a) and ribavirin in
      treatment-naive patients with chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Japan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), 2-arm, double-blind study to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of TMC435 (also referred to as jnj-38733214-aaa) versus placebo in
      combination with the standard of care (SoC) therapy (peginterferon alfa-2a [pegIFN alfa-2a]
      and ribavirin) in adult treatment-na√Øve patients (who never received treatment for HCV) with
      chronic genotype 1 HCV infection in Japan. The study objective is to evaluate and compare
      the efficacy of TMC435 vs placebo by the proportion of the patients with undetectable HCV
      ribonucleic acid (RNA). In the TMC435 treatment group, patients will receive 12 weeks of
      treatment with TMC435 (100 mg) once daily plus SoC followed by an additional 12 or 36 weeks
      of treatment with SoC. In the placebo treatment group, patients will receive 12 weeks of
      treatment with placebo once daily plus SoC followed by an additional 36 weeks of treatment
      with SoC. TMC435 is a 100-mg capsule and will be taken orally by mouth. The SoC treatment
      will be given for 24 or 48 weeks. Pegylated interferon is supplied as a vial containing 1.0
      mL solution with 180 mcg pegIFN alpha-2a and administered subcutaneously (injected by a
      syringe under the skin) once weekly. Ribavirin is given as 200-mg tablets (daily dose:
      600-1000 mg based on body weight), and taken orally by mouth two times a day after meals.
