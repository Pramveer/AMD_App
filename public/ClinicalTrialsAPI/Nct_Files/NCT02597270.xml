      The purpose of this study is to describe the genetic diversity of Hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      NS3/4a protease and NS5A protein of HCV in participants with chronic disease naive-drug or
      previously failed to double therapy (Peg-interferon and Ribavirin) and to identify the
      frequency of natural polymorphisms in HCV NS3/4a protease and NS5A protein that are
      associated with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs)-resistance.

      This is a multicenter, observational/non-interventional, cross-sectional study to describe
      the genetic diversity of and to identify the natural polymorphisms in HCV NS3/4a protease
      and NS5A protein of hepatitis C virus in Brazilian participants with chronic HCV infection.
      Brazilian participants with Genotype 1 HCV infection treatment naive participants or
      previously failed to double therapy (Peg-interferon-α and Ribavirin) will be included in the
      trial and will constitute the trial population.

    <description>After extraction of HCV RNA from collected blood samples, the sequences of the NS3/4A and NS5A genes of HCV will be amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) using specific primers for each genomic region. PCR products will be sequenced subsequently by direct sequencing. Detection of natural polymorphisms will be analyzed a comparison of the each sequence with the subtype consensus sequence.</description>

      The total blood volume to be collected will be approximately 15 milliliters (mL) (3 tubes,
      5mL each). Fasting is not required. The blood sample collection scheme was designed to
      collect the minimum number of blood samples that is necessary to accomplish the study
      objective. Blood samples will be frozen and incinerated 30 days after blood collection at
      the national central laboratory.
