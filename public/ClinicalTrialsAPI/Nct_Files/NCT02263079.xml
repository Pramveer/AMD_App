  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled, parallel group, open-label multicenter study will evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of a combination of Pegasys plus lamivudine compared with an untreated
      control group in children with chronic hepatitis B in the immune-tolerant phase. For
      patients receiving the combination, the approximate total study length is 6 years and two
      months.
