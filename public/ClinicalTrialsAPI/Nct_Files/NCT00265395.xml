    <textblock>
      This is a controlled, randomized, parallel-groups, open-label, multinational study designed
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PEG-Intron® (pegylated interferon alfa-2b) plus
      Rebetol® (ribavirin) in subjects with chronic hepatitis C. It is designed to evaluate
      whether 72 weeks of treatment with PEG-Intron plus Rebetol is more effective than 48 weeks
      of treatment in subjects with Genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C who exhibit a slow response to
      treatment.

          -  Confirmation of liver biopsy availability: Availability of a liver biopsy performed
             within 18 months prior to the Screen visit, with a pathology report confirming the
             histological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis.

          -  Compensated liver disease with the following minimum hematological, biochemical, and
             serological criteria at the screen visit (WNL = within normal limits, ULN = Upper
             Limit Normal):

               -  Hemoglobin values of equal or more than 12 g/dL for females and 13 g/dL for
                  males.

               -  White blood cells (WBCs) equal to or more than 3,000/mm^3

               -  Direct bilirubin up to 10% above ULN is acceptable.

               -  Indirect bilirubin up to 10% above ULN is acceptable (unless non-hepatitis
                  related factors such as Gilbert's disease explain an indirect bilirubin rise).
                  In such cases indirect bilirubin should be less than or equal to 3.0 mg/dL (less
                  than or equal to 51.3 µmol/L)

               -  Albumin up to 10% above ULN is acceptable.

          -  At the Screen Visit, fasting glucose must be 70-140 mg/dL. Results between 116-140
             mg/dL require repeat fasting glucose to be less than 140 mg/dL and HbA1C less than or
             equal to 8.5%. HbA1C must be less than or equal to 8.5% in diabetic subjects (whether

             females of childbearing potential are practicing adequate contraception.

          -  Female subjects cannot be pregnant or breastfeeding and must be either
             postmenopausal, surgically sterile or using 2 methods of birth control. While
             abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain method to prevent pregnancy,
             female patients of childbearing potential who are or who anticipate the possibility
             of becoming sexually active with a male partner must use a combination of the
             following 2 methods :

               -  Contraceptive pill or intrauterine device (IUD) or depot hormonal preparation
                  (ring, injection implant) and

               -  A barrier method of contraception such as diaphragm, sponge with spermicide,
                  condom, or a method of birth control considered acceptable by the study
                  physician. Contraceptive measures will be reviewed with female subjects at each
                  visit. Dual methods of contraception must be used for 1 month prior to the start
                  of treatment and 6 months after treatment discontinuation.

             must be negative.

          -  Confirmation by the principal investigator or a sub-investigator that sexually active
             male subjects are practicing a method of contraception considered acceptable
             (vasectomy, condom plus spermicide, plus relationship with a female partner who
             practices an acceptable method of contraception). Contraception must be used during
             the treatment period and for seven months (or 6 months, according to local label)
             after the completion of therapy, including condom use by male subjects with pregnant
             partners.

          -  For subjects with a history of hypertension or diabetes, written clearance from an
             ophthalmologist has to be obtained prior to treatment start.

        Exclusion Criteria:

               -  Subjects with mild depression may be considered for entry into the study
                  provided that a pre-treatment assessment demonstrates that the subject's

             been stable for 6 months may be included.

          -  Cirrhotic subjects whose ultrasound confirms hepatocellular carcinoma.

          -  Any other condition that, in the investigator's opinion, could determine that
             subject's participation in the study is not indicated or could interfere with the
             subject's participation in and completion of study.
