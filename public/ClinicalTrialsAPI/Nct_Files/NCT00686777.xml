    <textblock>
      The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy with
      subcutaneous (SC) Pegylated Interferon (PEG-IFN) alfa-2b 1.5 ug/kg/week plus low-dose
      ribavirin administered for 48 weeks in participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) who
      are infected with HCV genotype 1 high viral load, and weigh 50 kg or less.

    <description>SVR was defined as a viral response which was sustained at 24 weeks after the end of treatment as measured by Hepatitis C Virus Ribonucleic Acid (HCV-RNA) negativity.
HCV-RNA negativity was assessed by an reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, where a negative response was defined by a negative qualitative HCV-RNA result.</description>
