  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a physician directed education
      program on treatment compliance of hepatitis C patients administered triple drug therapy of
      pegylated interferon, ribavirin and boceprevir.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The new treatment paradigm for HCV in the era of protease inhibitors will add a level of
      complexity that was previously not seen with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. In addition
      to new concepts such as utilization of a lead-in period, compliance with a TID dosing
      regimen of a third agent, development of resistance, and futility rules and decision points
      have yet to be assessed in a real life practice setting. The OPTIMAL trial is designed to
      evaluate the impact of an education program for community sites participating in a CLDF
      study treating chronic HCV genotype 1 patients. Group A will be comprised of approximately
      30 CLDF designated Hepatology Centers of Educational Expertise (HCEE) and Group B will be
      comprised of approximately 60 community sites. Group A will also deliver the educational
      program regarding the use of HCV protease inhibitors, and the overall treatment of HCV to
      approximately two (2) community sites in it's geographic region. Group B will be comprised
      of community sites that have no previous clinical trial experience with boceprevir or an HCV
      protease inhibitor. For the purpose of this study, each community site in Group B will be
      assigned to an HCEE.

    <description>The primary objective will be to define treatment duration compliance rate (calculated as the actual treatment duration in weeks divided by the expected duration in weeks) based on individual patient treatment goals as defined in the OPTIMAL protocol for HCV patients treated with boceprevir, peginterferon and ribavirin for up to 48 weeks. Rates will be reported for HCEEs (Group A) and community sites enrolled in the Program (Group B).</description>

    <description>Rate of SVR was defined as the percentage of participants with HCV-RNA undetectable at follow-up Week 24. All percentages were based on the total number of participants originally randomized/enrolled to that particular arm.</description>

    <description>Determination of the quality of life for HCV patients treated with boceprevir, peginterferon and ribavirin at community sites and at HCEEs.
Patient scores per subscale (8) were obtained by subtracting the lowest possible raw score from the actual raw score x 100, divided by the lowest possible raw score subtracted from the highest possible raw score. Subscale scores were averaged (with standard deviation) for Group A and Group B. Composite Scores are standardized to the general US population having a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Higher score = improved quality of life.</description>
