    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, open-label, randomized, two-arm exploratory pilot clinical
      trial involving HIV-1 infected participants treated with suppressive combination
      antiretroviral combination therapy (cART). The study will test whether combined treatment
      with the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat and the immunomodulatory cytokine
      Interferon-alpha2a can reduce the residual reservoir of HIV-1 infected cells that persist
      during treatment with currently available antiretroviral drugs.

      This study is a prospective, double-arm, randomized, open-label exploratory clinical trial
      involving HIV-1 infected participants treated with suppressive combination antiretroviral
      combination therapy (cART). The primary objective of this study is to evaluate a new
      strategy for reducing the residual reservoir of HIV-1 infected cells that persists despite
      treatment with current HIV drugs. The clinical trial is conducted in the Infectious Diseases
      Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) at the Massachusetts General Hospital.

      The study medication includes two agents: Panobinostat is an oral tablet that can reverse
      HIV-1 latency, and awaken HIV from a &quot;sleeping&quot; condition during which it is protected from
      the human immune system. The second drug is interferon-alpha2a, an injectable cytokine that
      activates the immune system. The combined use of both agents may lead to immune-mediated
      elimination of HIV-1 infected cells in which viral latency has been reversed by
      panobinostat.

      All participants will receive four consecutive four-week treatment cycles comprising one
      week of treatment with panobinostat (20mg, dosed every second day on Monday, Wednesday,
      Friday), followed by three weeks off-treatment. Participants stratified by their study group
      will be 1:2 randomized to receive this treatment course with panobinostat alone (Arm A, 10
      participants total), or in combination with pegylated IFN-alpha2a (Arm B, 20 participants
      total). Subcutaneous injections with pegylated Interferon-alpha2a will be administered at
      the start of each week-long treatment course, simultaneously with the first dose of
      panobinostat during each treatment cycle. ART will be continued during the entire treatment
      duration in all study participants.

      Participants will undergo close monitoring for side effects during the entire time of study
      participation, and during a six-month post-treatment follow-up period. The total study
      duration will be 12 months.
