  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of telaprevir on early hepatitis
      (inflammation of the liver) C virus (HCV) viral kinetics in treatment-naive participants who
      are chronically (lasting a long time) infected with genotype 2 or 3 HCV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study), partially blinded, randomized (study drug assigned by chance)
      stratified (arrange in groups for analysis of results e.g., stratify by age, sex, etc.) for
      genotype, multiple dose study. The trial will consist of Screening period (6 weeks),
      Treatment period (24 or 26 weeks) and Follow-up period (24 weeks). The Treatment period will
      include 2 weeks investigational treatment phase and a 24 week standard treatment phase. All
      the eligible participants who were never treated for HCV will be enrolled for the trial and
      will receive the investigational treatment regimen to which they have been randomly assigned
      for 2 weeks. After this in the standard treatment phase participants will receive the
      standard treatment of care consisting of pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN)-alfa-2a 180
      microgram once weekly and ribavirin (RBV) 400 milligram twice per day. Efficacy will
      primarily be evaluated by HCV viral load quantification. Participant's safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

No relapse was defined as having no confirmed detectable HCV RNA (&gt;=10 IU/ml) during the follow-up period and after previous undetectable HCV RNA (&lt; 10 IU/ml) at EOT. Missing follow-up means no HCV RNA measurements during the follow-up period and after previous undetectable HCV RNA (&lt; 10 IU/ml) at EOT.
