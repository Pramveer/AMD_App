    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of TMC435 plus PSI-7977
      (GS7977) with or without ribavirin in patients who are chronically infected with genotype 1
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) and who did not respond to prior peginterferon/ribavirin therapy or
      are HCV treatment-naive (patients who never received treatment for HCV infection).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIa, randomized (the study medications are assigned by chance), open label
      (all people know the identity of the intervention) study of TMC435 plus PSI-7977 (GS7977)
      with or without ribavirin. The study consists of a screening phase (6 weeks); a treatment
      phase (12 or 24 week period); and a posttreatment phase (follow-up period up to Week 48).
      Approximately 180 patients will be enrolled in this study. Patients will be sequentially
      enrolled into two cohorts in this study. Cohort 1 (90 patients) will include patients
      without advanced hepatic fibrosis who did not respond to previous PegIFN/ribavirin therapy
      and Cohort 2 (90 patients) will include only patients with advanced hepatic fibrosis who did
      not respond to previous PegIFN/ribavirin therapy or are HCV treatment-naive. Safety will be
      evaluated throughout the study and will include evaluations of adverse events, clinical
      laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination. The entire study
      duration for each participant will be approximately 48 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has evidence of hepatic decompensation

          -  Has any liver disease of non-HCV etiology

          -  Has an infection/co-infection with non-genotype 1 HCV

          -  Has a co-infection with Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 or type 2 (HIV-1 or
             HIV-2) (positive HIV-1 or HIV-2 antibody test at screening)

          -  Has a co-infection with hepatitis B virus (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]
             positive)

          -  Has a history of malignancy within 5 years of the screening visit
