  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose, randomized, cross-sectional comparison study examining the relative
      safety and resulting blood level profiles after administration of a new boceprevir tablet
      formulation versus its current capsule formulation for treatment of chronic hepatitis C. In
      Part 1 of the study participants will receive boceprevir tablets and capsules under fed
      conditions. In Part 2 of the study a new group of participants will receive boceprevir
      tablets and capsules under fasted conditions.

             urinalysis) must be within normal limits or clinically acceptable to the investigator
             and within an allowed expanded range supplied by sponsor. However, subject's liver
             function test results (ie, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase
             [ALT]) must not be elevated above normal limits at Screening and on Day -1. No
             rescreening of liver function tests will be allowed.

             73 pmol/L), or

          2. surgically sterilized at least 3 months prior to baseline (eg, documented

             hysterectomy or tubal ligation), or

          3. premenopausal and if unsterilized must have used a medically

             accepted method of contraception for 3 months (or abstained from

             the screening period prior to receiving trial medication) and for

             2 months after stopping the trial medication. An acceptable method of

             contraception includes one of the following:

        i. stable oral, transdermal, injectable, or sustained-release vaginal

        hormonal contraceptive regimen without breakthrough uterine

        bleeding for 3 months prior to Screening; in addition, during

        study use of condom and/or spermicide (when marketed in the

        country).

        ii. intrauterine device (inserted at least 2 months prior to Screening

        visit); in addition, during study use of condom and/or spermicide

        (when marketed in the country).

        iii. condom (male or female) with spermicide (when marketed

        within the country),

        iv. diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide (when marketed

        within the country) and condom (male),

        - Non-vasectomized men must agree to use a condom with spermicide or abstain from sexual
        intercourse, during the trial and for 1 month after stopping the medication.

             3 months of ending the study), or are breastfeeding.

        absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of any drug. The investigator

        should be guided by evidence of any of the following, and be discussed with

        the sponsor prior to enrollment into the trial:

             reactions or asthmatic episodes) which, in the opinion of the investigator and

             sponsor, interfere with their ability to participate in the trial.

             - Subjects who smoke more than 10 cigarettes or equivalent tobacco use per

             day.

               -  Subjects who have a history of malignancy.
