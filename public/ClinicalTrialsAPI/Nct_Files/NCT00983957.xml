    <description>Ethinyl Estradiol is an analyte of Ortho Tri-Cyclen. Ethinyl Estradiol was measured in plasma, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) by a validated analytical method during the period of known analyte stability. Cmax was measured in picograms per milliliter (pg/mL) and derived from 24 hour plasma concentration versus time data using non-compartmental methods. Pre-dose concentrations and concentrations prior to the first quantifiable concentration that were below the lower limit of quantitation were treated as missing.</description>
