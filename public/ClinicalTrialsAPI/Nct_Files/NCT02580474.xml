        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HCV RNA Positive and Genotype 1b

          -  No history or signs or symptoms of decompensated liver disease or hepatocellular
             carcinoma within 6 months

          -  A patient who is on dialysis, or if not MDRD eGFR&lt;30ml/min

          -  HCV treatment history: HCV treatment-naive participants, defined as never having
             received HCV treatment with any approved or investigational drug (including
             vaccines); OR HCV treatment-experienced, defined as having received previous HCV
             treatment with any (pegylated) interferon ([Peg]IFN)-based drug regimen (with or
             without ribavirin [RBV] and not including a direct-acting antiviral agent [DAA]).
             Last dose in this previous HCV treatment course should have occurred at least 2
             months prior to screening

          -  No baseline mutation NS5A polymorphism including L31F/I/M/V and Y93H

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient who having received Daclatasvir or Asunaprevir

          -  Pregnant women, women who are breastfeeding or who believe they may wish to become
             pregnant during the course of the study

          -  Evidence of a medical condition contributing to chronic liver disease other than HCV
             or seropositive for HIV

          -  Diagnosed or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma or other malignancies

          -  Any history of, or current evidence of, clinical hepatic decompensation (e.g.,
             ascites, encephalopathy or variceal hemorrhage)

          -  Received solid organ or bone marrow transplant

          -  Current alcohol or substance abuse judged by the investigator to potentially
             interfere with subject compliance

          -  Significant renal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, or neurological disease and
             uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension in the opinion of the investigator

          -  Known hypersensitivity to study drugs, metabolites, or formulation excipients

          -  Who has taken investigational drugs within 2 months.
