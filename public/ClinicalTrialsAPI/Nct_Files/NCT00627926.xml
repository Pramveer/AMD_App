    <time_frame>24 weeks after last planned dose of study treatment (up to Week 72)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The plasma HCV RNA level was measured using Roche TaqMan HCV RNA assay. The lower limit of quantification was 25 international units per milliliter (IU/mL) and the lower limit of detection was 10 IU/mL. Two results are reported: 1) Protocol defined SVR: undetectable HCV RNA at 24 weeks after the last planned dose of study treatment without any confirmed detectable HCV RNA between end of treatment visit (up to Week 48) and 24 weeks after last planned dose (up to Week 72); 2) SVR as per FDA guidance (snapshot analysis): undetectable HCV RNA at 24 weeks after the last planned dose of study treatment. Analysis was based only on the HCV RNA assessment in visit window (+/-2 weeks); if there were more than 1 assessment in the window, the last measurement was used.</description>

    <description>Viral relapse was defined as having detectable HCV RNA during antiviral follow-up. The plasma HCV RNA level was measured using Roche TaqMan HCV RNA assay. The lower limit of quantification was 25 IU/mL and the lower limit of detection was 10 IU/mL. For viral relapse, 2 analyses were performed: planned and actual. The planned analyses was measured from the end of treatment (EOT) visit to 24 weeks after the last planned dose of study treatment. The actual analyses was measured from the EOT visit to 24 weeks after the last actual dose of study treatment.</description>

    <description>Criteria for grading severity (toxicity) of ALT and AST: Grade 0 (&lt;1.25*upper limit of normal [ULN]); Grade 1 (mild=1.25 to 2.5*ULN); Grade 2 (moderate=2.6 to 5.0*ULN); Grade 3 (severe= greater than 5.0 to 20.0*ULN); Grade 4 (life-threatening= greater than 20.0*ULN). Number of subjects with Grade 3 shift (from Grade 0, Grade 1 or Grade 2 baseline) and Grade 4 shift (from Grade 0, Grade 1, Grade 2 or Grade 3 baseline) are reported.

    <measure>Noninvasive Markers of Fibrosis: Number of Subjects With Improvement in FibroTest Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 24 weeks after last planned dose of study treatment (up to Week 72)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>FibroTest analysis was a biomarker analysis test used to generate a score that was correlated with the degree of liver damage. The FibroTest score was calculated from the results of a six-parameter blood test, combining six serum markers (alpha-2-macroglobulin, haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A1, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, total bilirubin, and alanine transaminase). The FibroTest score (F score) may range from 0.00 (Grade F0) to 1.00 (Grade F4), where F0= no fibrosis and F4=cirrhosis. Results were presented separately for subjects who achieved SVR at 24 weeks after the last planned dose of study treatment and those who did not achieve SVR at 24 weeks after the last planned dose of study treatment. Improvement was defined as decrease of at least 1 grade relative to baseline.</description>

    <description>FSS was a 9-item questionnaire where each item was scored on a scale of 1 to 7 (higher scores indicated higher influence of fatigue). FSS total score was calculated as the average of individual items on the questionnaire and FSS total score ranged from 1 to 7, where higher score indicated higher influence of fatigue.</description>

    <description>AE: any adverse change from the subject's baseline (pre-treatment) condition, including any adverse experience, abnormal recording or clinical laboratory assessment value which occurs during the course of the study, whether it is considered related to the study drug or not. An adverse event includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug. SAE: medical event or condition, which falls into any of the following categories, regardless of its relationship to the study drug: death, life threatening adverse experience, in-patient hospitalization/prolongation of hospitalization, persistent/significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, important medical event. &quot;Study drug&quot; includes all investigational agents (including placebo, if applicable) administered during the course of the study.</description>
