      The objective of this study is to compare the relative bioavailability of ribavirin 200 mg
      tablets (manufactured by TEVA Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. and distributed by TEVA
      Pharmaceuticals USA) with that of COPEGUS™ 200 mg tablets (Roche) in healthy, adult,
      non-smoking, females (who are unable to become pregnant) under non-fasting conditions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects selected for this study will be non-smokers, at least 18 years of age,
             and a female whi is physically unable to become pregnant (postmenopausal for at least
             6 months or surgically sterile). Subjects will have a BMI (body mass index) of 30 or
             less.

          -  Each subject shall be given a general physical examination within 28 days of
             initiation of the study. Such examination includes but is not limited to, blood
             pressure, general observations, and history.

          -  Each subject will be given a serum pregnancy test as part of the pre-study screening
             process.

          -  Adequate blood and urine samples should be obtained within 28 days before beginning
             of the first period and at the end of the trial for clinical laboratory measurements.

          -  Clinical laboratory measurements will include the following:

               -  Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, platelets, and white
                  blood cell count with differential.

               -  Clinical Chemistry: creatinine, BUN, glucose, SGOT/AST, SGPT/ALT, bilirubin, and
                  alkaline phosphatase.

               -  Urine Analysis: pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin,
                  occult blood, and cells.

               -  HIV Screen: pre-study only

               -  Hepatitis-B, C Screen: pre-study only

               -  Drugs of Abuse Screen: (pre-study and at each check-in)

          -  Subjects will be selected if all above are normal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a significant recent history of chronic alcohol consumption (past 2
             years), drug addiction, or serious gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic or cardiovascular
             disease, tuberculosis, epilepsy, asthma (past 5 years), diabetes, psychosis or
             glaucoma will not be eligible for this study.

          -  Subjects whose clinical laboratory test values are greater than 20% outside the
             normal range may be retested. If the clinical values are outside the range on
             retesting, the subject will not be eligible to participate in the study unless the
             clinical investigator dems the result to not be significant.

          -  Subjects who have a history of allergic responses to the class of drug being tested
             will be excluded from the study.

          -  Subjects who use tobacco in any form will not be eligible to participate in the
             study. Three months abstinence is required.

          -  All subjects will have urine samples assayed for the presence of drugs of abuse as
             part of the clinical laboratory screening procedures and at each dosing period
             check-in. Subjects found to have urine concentrations of any of the tested drugs will
             not be allowed to participate.

          -  Subjects should not have donated blood and/or plasma for at least thirty (30) days
             prior to the first dosing of the study.

          -  Subjects who have taken any investigational drug within thirty (30) days prior to the
             first dosing of the study will not be allowed to participate.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or who are able (women with child bearing potential)
             to become pregnant during the study will not be allowed to participate.

          -  All female subjects will be screened for pregnancy at check-in each study period.
             Subjects with positive or inconclusive results will be withdrawn from the study.

          -  Subjects who do not tolerate venipuncture will not be allowed to participate.
