    <textblock>
      This is an observational, multicenter, nationwide study where information will be collected
      on the follow-up of participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) who have a viral
      response at the end of treatment with pegylated interferon alfa-2b (PEG IFN alfa-2b) plus
      ribavirin (RBV) administered according to the directions on the products' labeling. No
      administration of treatment is planned as a result of study enrollment.

    <description>Relapse rate is defined as the percentage of participants with negative viral load (HCV RNA-) at EOT who have positive viral load (HCV RNA+) at 6 months after EOT.

    <description>Late relapse was defined as having a Sustained Viral Response (SVR) at 24 weeks of follow-up and subsequently having a positive viral load 48 weeks later at Week 72.
SVR was defined as negative for HCV RNA at Week 24 of follow-up.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)[any genotype] who received
             pegylated interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin as first treatment for hepatitis C.

          -  Negative HCV RNA at the end of treatment (24 or 48 weeks according to the product
             labeling as appropriate), measured by the assay used at each institution. Only
             institutions using an assay with a limit of detection of 50 IU/mL or less will be
             eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of childbearing potential (i.e., premenopausal women and women who are less
             than 6 months postmenopausal) who will not use an appropriate contraceptive method
             during the course of the clinical study. Appropriate contraceptives include double
             barrier methods (eg, diaphragm or condom plus spermicide), intrauterine device, oral,
             injectable or subcutaneous hormonal contraceptive, or surgically sterilized partner.

          -  Completed treatment with pegylated interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin more than 4
             weeks before study entry.

          -  Positive HCV RNA at the end of treatment (24 or 48 weeks according to the product
             labeling as appropriate).

          -  Participants treated for a period shorter than the enrollment period.

          -  Co-infection with Human Immumodeficiency Virus (HIV).

          -  Co-infected with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV).
