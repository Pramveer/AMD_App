  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will receive PegIntron injection pen (Peginterferon alfa-2b) and Rebetol
      (Ribavirin) combination therapy as their usual medical treatment. The current study aims to
      evaluate whether the previously introduced, and now widely accepted and implemented
      educational program, which represents additional efforts in everyday practice to increase
      patient compliance, will succeed in achieving adherence rate in treated participants similar
      to the extent demonstrated by clinical trials.

    <description>Participants who continued treatment beyond Week 12 (i.e., 24 or 48 weeks depending on the viral genotype) were assessed for triple-80 compliance. Triple-80 compliant, or simply compliant, participants were those that received &gt;= 80% of the planned total doses of both pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin for &gt;=80% of the duration of the therapy. 3 rates were computed: Compliance with study duration, compliance with pegylated interferon dose, and compliance with ribavirin dose. A participant was defined as triple-80 compliant, if none of the 3 rates as defined above were less than 80.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieved Sustained Virological Response as Assessed at 24-week Post-treatment Follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks following completion of 24 or 48 weeks of therapy</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Sustained virologic response (SVR) was assessed at post-treatment Follow-up Week 24. Day 1 of the Follow-up period was defined as the first day after the last dose day. A participant was considered a sustained responder if the participant had undetectable Hepatitis C virus Ribonucleic acid (HCV-RNA) level (based on qualitative test result) at Follow-up Week 24. If a participant with missing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) data at Follow-up Week 24 had undetectable HCV-RNA level at Follow-up Week 12, the participant was also considered as a sustained responder.</description>

    <description>Number of participants self-administering Pegylated interferon alfa-2b injection pen. If a participant changed the way he or she administered the injection pen during the course of the study (from self-administering to clinic-administering or the other way around), that participant was also considered as self-administering.</description>
