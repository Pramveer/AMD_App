  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to further assess the potency of PF-00868554, an HCV polymerase
      inhibitor, in subjects chronically infected with HCV by evaluating the antiviral activity of
      PF-00868554 in combination with current standard of care therapy, pegylated
      interferon-alpha2a (PEGASYS) and ribavirin (COPEGUS).

          -  Subjects who have discontinued IFN-a containing regimens after &lt;2 weeks of therapy
             due to tolerability issues are considered treatment naive.

          -  Genotype 1.

          -  A diagnosis of chronic HCV infection for at least 6 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of acute or chronic infection with HIV or HBV.

          -  Exposure within the previous three months to an investigational anti-HCV agent.

          -  Evidence of severe or decompensated liver disease.

          -  Subjects with liver disease unrelated to HCV infection.
