    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TMC435 in combination
      with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin in chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C virus
      (HCV)-infected participants who are treatment-naive or treatment-experienced (prior relapser
      or non-responder to Interferon-based therapy) in Japan.

      This is an open-label study (all people involved know the identity of the intervention) to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of TMC435 (also referred to as jnj-38733214-aaa) in
      combination with the standard of care therapy (SoC: peginterferon [pegIFN] alfa-2b and
      ribavirin) in adult, genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected participants who are
      treatment-naive (never received treatment for HCV), prior relapsers (relapsed after previous
      interferon [IFN]-based therapy), or non-responders (failed to respond to previous IFN-based
      therapy) in Japan. The study objective is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and
      pharmacokinetics of TMC435. A sufficient number of participants who are treatment-naive,
      prior relapsers to treatment with IFN-based therapy, and prior non-responders to treatment
      with IFN-based therapy will be enrolled and assigned to 1 of 3 panels (referred to as
      treatment groups). Participants who are treatment-naive or prior relapsers to IFN-based
      therapy will receive 12 weeks of treatment with TMC435 (100 mg) once daily with pegIFN
      alfa-2b and ribavirin (PR) followed by an additional 12 or 24 weeks of treatment with PR.
      Participants who are non-responders to IFN-based therapy will receive 12 weeks of treatment
      with TMC435 (100 mg) once daily with PR followed by an additional 36 weeks of treatment with
      PR. TMC435 is a 100-mg capsule and will be taken orally by mouth. The SoC treatment will
      consist of Pegylated interferon (PegIFN alpha-2b) (1.5 mcg/kg) injected with a syringe
      subcutaneously (under the skin) once weekly and ribavirin 200-mg capsules (daily dose:
      600-1000 mg based on body weight) taken orally by mouth 2 times a day after meals for 24 or
      48 weeks.
