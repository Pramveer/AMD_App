      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of peginterferon alfa-2a
      (PEG-2a) in combination with ribavirin (RV) and PEG-2a alone for the treatment of chronic
      hepatitis C virus (CHC) infection in children.

      The purpose of this study is also to determine whether PEG-2a in combination with RV or
      PEG-2a alone will result in a longer response rate in children with CHC.
