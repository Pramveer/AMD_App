  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter, phase IV study will evaluate the relationship between the drop
      in hemoglobin levels and sustained virological response in patients with chronic hepatitis C
      genotype 1 treated with Copegus (ribavirin) and Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a). Patients
      will receive Copegus 1000 mg or 1200 mg orally daily and Pegasys 180 mcg subcutaneously
      weekly. Anticipated time on study treatment, depending on virological response, will be 48
      or 72 weeks.
