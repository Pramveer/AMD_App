    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antiviral efficacy of
      ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) fixed-dose combination (FDC) administered for 12 or 24 weeks
      in adults with genotype 1 or 4 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with sickle cell disease
      (SCD).

Relapse
HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ during the posttreatment period having achieved HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at end of treatment, confirmed with 2 consecutive values or last available posttreatment measurement</description>
