  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2 arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of PEGASYS plus COPEGUS, with or
      without concomitant pioglitazone, on hepatitis C virus titers in treatment-naive patients
      with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C, and insulin resistance. Patients will be randomized to
      receive either a)PEGASYS 180 micrograms/week + Copegus 1000-1600 mg/day (according to body
      weight) for 48 weeks or b)16 weeks of pioglitazone (30 mg daily for 8 weeks, then 45 mg
      daily for 8 weeks), followed by PEGASYS 180 micrograms/week + Copegus 1000-1600 mg/day +
      pioglitazone 45 mg daily for 48 weeks. The anticipated time on study treatment is 1-2 years,
      and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.

    <description>Insulin resistance (IR) is calculated using the following formula:
HOMA score = (fasting glucose in mg/dL × fasting insulin in μIU/mL) / 405.
