    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy of boceprevir (BOC) in combination with PegIntron
      (pegylated interferon alfa-2b) (PEG) and ribavirin (RBV) in response guided therapy compared
      to the efficacy of standard-of-care therapy alone in adult subjects with chronic hepatitis C
      (CHC) genotype 1 who failed prior treatment with pegylated interferon and RBV in the Asia
      Pacific population.

    <description>PEG + RBV for 4 weeks followed by BOC + PEG + RBV for 32 weeks. At the Treatment Week 36 visit, participants with undetectable HCV-RNA at Treatment Weeks 8 and 12 will proceed to 36 weeks of post-treatment follow-up. Participants with detectable HCV-RNA at Treatment Week 8 and undetectable HCV-RNA at Treatment Week 12 will continue on BOC + PEG + RBV until Treatment Week 36, receive placebo + PEG + RBV until Treatment Week 48, and then proceed to 24 weeks of post-treatment follow-up. Participants with any HCV-RNA result at Treatment Week 8 and detectable HCV-RNA at Treatment Week 12 will discontinue treatment and proceed to 24 weeks of post-treatment follow-up.</description>
