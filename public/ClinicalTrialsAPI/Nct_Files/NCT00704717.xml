    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate patient satisfaction in hepatitis C patients
      receiving PegIntron pen plus Rebetol. The rationale is that the effectiveness of treatment
      is correlated with adherence to the prescribed regimen which, in turn, is affected by the
      ease of use and accuracy of treatment administration. Since the PegIntron pen is a novel
      device, the results of this study will be used to improve the training of patients and
      healthcare providers in PegIntron pen use.
