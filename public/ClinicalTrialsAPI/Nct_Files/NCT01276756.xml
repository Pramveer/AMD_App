  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis C has become an endemic disease in Egypt with a rising prevalence
      (genotype 4), worldwide it also poses a significant health burden. To date standard of care
      treatment (pegylated interferon and ribavirin) give modest results with a sustained
      virological response (SVR) of about 50%. Several pharmaceutical and herbal agents have been
      used with an aim to improve current results. Recent reports have suggested an increased SVR
      with the addition of Nitazoxanide to standard of care. The results are preliminary and need
      to be confirmed. This is a randomized trial to assess the efficacy of nitazoxanide added to
      standard of care compared to standard of care alone.

    <description>sustained virological response is defined as a negative HCV PCR at 180 days after the end of treatment (End of treatment being at 48 weeks for Group A, 52 weeks for Group B).
