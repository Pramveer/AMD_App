  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates safety and efficacy of vaniprevir (MK7009), when administered with
      Pegylated-Interferon (peg-IFN) and Ribavirin, in Japanese patients with Hepatitis C
      infection. The primary hypotheses are that 1.) the proportion of patients achieving rapid
      viral response (RVR) in one or more of the vaniprevir treatment groups is superior to that
      in the placebo group, when each is administered concomitantly with pegylated interferon
      (peg-IFN) α-2a and ribavirin; and 2.) vaniprevir at the studied doses is well tolerated
      compared with placebo, when each is administered concomitantly with peg-IFN α-2a and
      ribavirin for 28 days.

    <description>Rapid viral response (RVR) is defined as undetectable hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) at Week 4. Serum HCV RNA levels were measured using Roche COBAS TaqMan HCV Auto assay. The limit of quantification was 1.2 log IU/mL (15 IU/mL) and the limit of detection was &lt;1.2 log IU/mL, but with no specific value. The Data-As-Observed (DAO) approach was used to handle missing data.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline in HCV RNA at Week 4 was calculated by subtracting Week 4 HCV RNA level from Baseline HCV RNA level. HCV RNA is measured as International Units per milliliter (IU/mL). Serum HCV RNA levels were measured using Roche COBAS TaqMan HCV Auto assay. The DAO approach was used to handle missing data.</description>
