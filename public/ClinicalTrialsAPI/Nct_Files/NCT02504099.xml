      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (OBV/PTV/r), with or without dasabuvir (DSV)
      coadministered with or without ribavirin (RBV) for 12 or 24 weeks in adult patients with

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, at least 18 years of age at time of screening.

          2. Chronic HCV infection prior to study enrollment with screening laboratory results
             indicating HCV genotype 1 or 4 infection.

          3. Early stage HCC diagnosed based on the typical hallmark of HCC (hypervascular in the
             arterial phase with washout in the portal venous or delayed phases)

          4. Compensated cirrhosis defined as a Child-Pugh score of 5 or 6 at Screening.

             • A minimal rim of ascites if detected at imaging is acceptable. Exclude ascites that
             requires the need to apply diuretic treatment to control ascites.

          5. Documented complete response to HCC treatment.

          6. Females must be post-menopausal for more than 2 years or surgically sterile or
             practicing acceptable forms of birth control

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of known strong or moderate inducers of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) in subjects
             receiving OBV/PTV/r with and without DSV, strong inducers and inhibitors (e.g.,
             gemfibrozil) of cytochrome P450 2C8 (CYP2C8) in subjects receiving OBV/PTV/r with
             DSV, medications contraindicated for ritonavir or RBV (for those that receive RBV)
             within 2 weeks or 10 half-lives (if known), whichever is longer, prior to study drug
             . For medications contraindicated with AbbVie's 2-DAA and 3-DAA regimen, refer to the
             recommended prescribing information section of the approved local product labels.

          2. Positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or anti-human
             immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV Ab).

          3. Patients regardless of eligibility to liver transplant, who have a comorbid disease
             that might preclude completion of study follow-up.

          4. Clinically significant abnormalities, other than HCV infection, in a subject with HCC
             based upon the medical history, physical examination, vital signs, laboratory profile
             and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that make the subject an unsuitable candidate
             for this study in the opinion of the investigator.
