    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of sofosbuvir
      (SOF) with ribavirin (RBV) in Egyptian adults with chronic genotype 4 hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) infection.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>SVR12 was defined as HCV RNA &lt; the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ; ie, 25 IU/mL) at 12 weeks after stopping study treatment.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Adverse Events Leading to Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug(s)</measure>

    <description>The percentage of participants discontinuing any study drug due to an adverse event was summarized.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response at 4 and 24 Weeks After Discontinuation of Therapy (SVR4 and SVR24)</measure>
    <time_frame>Posttreatment Weeks 4 and 24</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>SVR4 and SVR24 were defined as HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at 4 and 24 weeks following the last dose of study drug, respectively.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Experiencing On-treatment Virologic Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>On-treatment virologic failure was defined as:
Viral breakthrough: HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after having previously had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ while on treatment, confirmed with 2 consecutive values (second confirmation value may have been posttreatment) or with a last available on-treatment measurement and no subsequent follow-up values, or
Viral rebound: &gt; 1 log10 IU/mL increase in HCV RNA from nadir while on treatment, confirmed with 2 consecutive values (second confirmation value may have been posttreatment) or with a last available on-treatment measurement and no subsequent follow-up values, or
Nonresponse: HCV RNA persistently ≥ LLOQ through 8 weeks of treatment</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Experiencing Viral Relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Posttreatment Week 24</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Viral relapse was defined as having achieved undetectable HCV RNA levels (HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ) at end of treatment, but did not achieve an SVR.</description>
