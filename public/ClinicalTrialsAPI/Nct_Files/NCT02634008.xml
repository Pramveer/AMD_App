      An open label, multicentre, international pilot study of paritaprevir/ritonavir, ombitasvir,
      dasabuvir with or without ribavirin for people with recently acquired hepatitis C virus
      infection with or without HIV co-infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of a highly potent IFN-sparing drug combination in the setting of recently acquired
      genotype (GT) 1 HCV infection is hypothesised to result in the vast majority of patients
      achieving SVR. In this setting, it is anticipated that therapy can be shortened relative to
      that used in established chronic infection. A short course IFN-free strategy is likely to be
      highly attractive to both patients and clinicians and if proven may further encourage early
      HCV testing and diagnosis.

      In this pilot study, the investigators plan to explore the safety, efficacy and feasibility
      of the IFN-sparing combination of paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir, dasabuvir and ribavirin
      for 8 (and then potentially 6) weeks in patients with documented recently acquired GT 1 HCV
      infection.
