  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will provide treatment or re-treatment with PEGASYS as monotherapy or
      in combination with ribavirin (Copegus), to patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) who have
      participated in a previous Roche or Roche partner protocol where access to treatment or
      re-treatment was promised or deemed appropriate following completion of the original
      protocol ('donor' protocol). Patients who qualify for treatment or re-treatment will begin
      PEGASYS monotherapy, at a maximum dose of 180 µg weekly, or combination therapy with
      Copegus, 800-1200 mg daily, as continuation of treatment after the wash-out period defined
      in their donor protocol. PEGASYS treatment is not to exceed the approved treatment duration
      of 48 weeks in genotype G1 with a treatment-free follow up period of 24 weeks.

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

    <description>Participants received ribavirin with food, as the bioavailability of ribavirin is increased when taken with food. Ribavirin was administered as split doses, that is, 2 doses were given 12 hours apart, 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening. Participants received either 1000 or 1200 mg ribavirin per day according to body weight: 400 mg (2 tablets) in the morning and 600 mg (3 tablets) in the evening for participants weighing &lt; 75 kg or 600 mg (3 tablets) in the morning and 600 mg (3 tablets) in the evening for participants weighing ≥ 75 kg.</description>
