  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to compare the efficacy of boceprevir (SCH 503034)
      800 mg three times a day (TID) orally (PO) in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b
      (PegIFN-2b) 1.5 µg/kg weekly (QW) subcutaneously (SC) plus weight-based dosing (WBD) of
      ribavirin (RBV) (600 mg/day to 1400 mg/day) PO to therapy with PegIFN-2b + RBV alone in
      adult participants coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and previously
      untreated chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1.

      Boceprevir is a potent, orally administered, novel serine protease inhibitor, specifically
      designed to inhibit the HCV nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) protease and, thereby, inhibit
      viral replication in HCV-infected host cells. The mechanism of inhibition represents a new
      mechanism of action compared to both interferon alfa and ribavirin. Based on previous
      experience with PegIFN-2b and RBV in combination with boceprevir in the HCV-monoinfected
      population, this combination treatment is expected to provide significant benefit to the
      HIV/HCV coinfected population. Given the high unmet medical need of these participants and
      the benefit of the addition of boceprevir to PegIFN-2b/RBV, it is important to demonstrate
      the safety and efficacy of boceprevir in combination with PegIFN-2b/RBV in participants
      coinfected with HIV/HCV.

      This is a randomized, multi-center trial, double-blinded for boceprevir or placebo in
      combination with open-label PegIFN-2b/RBV in participants coinfected with HIV and previously
      untreated chronic HCV (genotype 1), to be conducted in conformance with Good Clinical
      Practice (GCP). This trial consists of two arms, one control arm (Arm 1) and one
      experimental arm (Arm 2). Participants in the control arm (Arm 1) may receive
      boceprevir/PegIFN-2b/RBV via a crossover arm.

    <description>SVR24 is defined as undetectable plasma hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV-RNA) at 24 weeks after the end of all study treatment. If there was no value in the FW24 visit window, the closest value available chronologically after this window was used; if a value was still missing after that, the value from Follow-up Week 12 (FW12) was used. HCV-RNA is detected by a nucleic acid amplification test and the lower limit of detection for this assay is 9.3 IU/mL.</description>

    <description>EVR was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at Treatment Week (TW) 2, 4, 8, or 12. HCV-RNA was detected by a nucleic acid amplification test and the lower limit of detection for this assay is 9.3 IU/mL.</description>

    <description>The virologic response at FW12 was considered SVR12 with an additional rule for handling missing data: participants with missing HCV-RNA assessment at FW12 but having non-missing, undetectable HCV-RNA assessments at both FW4 and FW24, were assumed to be responders for SVR12. HCV-RNA was detected by a nucleic acid amplification test and the lower limit of detection for this assay is 9.3 IU/mL.</description>

    <description>This is a measure of the change in the amount of HCV-RNA in the plasma at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. HCV-RNA was detected by a nucleic acid amplification test and the lower limit of detection for this assay is 9.3 IU/mL.</description>

    <description>Virologic breakthrough is defined as achieving undetectable HCV-RNA and subsequently having an HCV-RNA level of &gt;1000 IU/mL. Incomplete Virologic Response/Rebound is defined as having a one log10 increase in HCV-RNA from the participant's nadir, with an HCV-RNA &gt;1000 IU/mL.
