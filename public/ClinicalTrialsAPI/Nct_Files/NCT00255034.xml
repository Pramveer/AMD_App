  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an Australian, open-label, multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial
      designed to assess the efficacy of combination therapy with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and
      ribavirin for 48 weeks versus 24 weeks in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C
      (treatment-naïve genotype 3 subjects with high viral loads who have a METAVIR score of at
      least F1A2). The primary endpoint will be a sustained virological response defined by
      undetectable HCV RNA in serum at 24 weeks after completion of therapy.

             deficiency, Wilson's disease, autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease,
             drug-related liver disease.

          -  Hepatocellular carcinoma.

          -  Decompensated cirrhosis (ascites, history of encephalopathy or bleeding varices,
             serum albumin &lt;35 g/L, prothrombin time (PT) prolonged by greater than 3 sec).

          -  Significant cardiovascular dysfunction within the past 6 months (e.g., angina,
             congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, severe hypertension, or significant
             arrhythmia) or participants with an ECG showing clinically significant abnormalities.

             thrombocytopenic purpura, systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune hemolytic anemia,
             scleroderma, severe psoriasis).

          -  Hemophilia or any hemoglobinopathy, including but not limited to thalassemia major.

             psychoses, current suicidal ideation, and/or suicidal attempts.

          -  Ongoing substance abuse, e.g. alcohol, I.V. drugs or inhalants that in the opinion of
             the investigator would jeopardize the patient's ability to comply with study
             requirements.

          -  Clinically significant ophthalmological disorders.

          -  Treatment or recent treatment with immunosuppressive agents (excluding short-term
             corticosteroid withdrawal) and immunosuppressed transplant recipients.

          -  Poorly controlled thyroid disease.

          -  Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would make the patient
             unsuitable for enrolment, or could interfere with the patient participating in and
             completing the clinical trial program.
