      This study will evaluate the antiviral efficacy, safety, and tolerability of sofosbuvir plus
      ribavirin administered for 16 weeks and 24 weeks in participants with chronic genotype 1
      (GT1) or genotype 3 (GT3) hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

Breakthrough (confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after having previously had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ while on treatment), or
Rebound (confirmed &gt; 1 log10 IU/mL increase in HCV RNA from nadir while on treatment), or
Non-response (HCV RNA persistently ≥ LLOQ through 8 weeks of treatment)</description>
