  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of two dosages of
      PegIntron for treating hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive chronic hepatitis B compared
      with the approved dosage, which is PegIntron 1.0 microgram (mcg)/kg given once a week for 24
      weeks. This study compares dosages of (1) 1.5 mcg/kg once a week for 24 weeks and (2) 1.5
      mcg/kg once a week for 48 weeks with the approved dosage. All subjects are followed for 24
      weeks after their treatment ends.
