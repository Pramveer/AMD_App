  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of
      multiple oral doses of ABT-450/ritonavir (r), ABT-333 (also known as dasabuvir), or ABT-072
      in hepatitis C virus (HCV), genotype 1-infected, treatment-naïve adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 2a, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study in
      chronically, hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1-infected participants designed to explore
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, antiviral activity, as well as the evolution and
      persistence to resistance of ABT-450/r, ABT-333, or ABT-072. Participants were treated with
      ABT-450/r, ABT-333, or ABT-072 monotherapy for 3 days, followed by 81 days (12 weeks minus 3
      days of monotherapy) of ABT-450/r, ABT-333, or ABT-072 combined with pegylated
      interferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV), followed by 36 weeks of pegIFN/RBV alone. Participants
      randomized to an ABT-450/r treatment group who achieved rapid virologic response (RVR) and
      had HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels &lt; 25 IU/mL at all subsequent visits were eligible to
      stop pegIFN/RBV therapy on or after Week 24.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Plasma HCV RNA levels (reported as log10 IU/mL) were determined for each sample using a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay that had a lower limit of detection of 10 IU/mL and a lower limit of quantification of 25 IU/mL. The baseline value was the HCV RNA level before the first dose of study drug on Day 1. The maximal change during monotherapy was the difference from baseline to the lowest log10 HCV RNA level anytime after the first dose of study drug on Day 1 through the last log10 HCV RNA level before the first dose of study drug on Day 4. Data are reported as the mean ± standard deviation.</description>

    <description>Baseline samples were analyzed for resistance-associated amino acid variants using population and clonal sequencing and were compared with the appropriate reference sequence (1a-H77 or 1b-Con1).

Available samples at Day 4 with HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL were analyzed for resistance-associated variants using population and clonal sequencing and were compared with the baseline sequences to assess amino acid changes. Phenotypic resistance to ABT-450 at Day 4 was assessed by calculating the fold difference in the EC50 compared with the EC50 for the corresponding baseline sample.
