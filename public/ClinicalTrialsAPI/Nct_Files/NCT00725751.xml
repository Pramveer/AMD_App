  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although injection drug users represent the majority of new and existing cases of infection
      with hepatitis C virus (HCV), many lack access to treatment because of concerns about
      adherence, effectiveness, and reinfection. On the basis of a small but growing body of
      evidence showing that injection drug users can undergo treatment for HCV infection
      successfully, the 2002 NIH Consensus Statement on Hepatitis C has recommended that substance
      users be treated for HCV infection on a case-by-case basis. In this study, all patients will
      receive pegylated interferon alfa-2b (PegIFN-2b) and ribavirin according to European
      labeling; one cohort of participants will also be receiving substitution therapy (opioid
      medicines with long-lasting effects [methadone + buprenorphine] or morphine).

    <description>SVR was defined as a hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) value below the limit of detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. For participants with Genotype 1 or 4 completion of treatment was at Week 48; for participants with Genotype 2, 3, or 1 with low viral load or rapid virologic response, completion of therapy was at Week 24.</description>
