  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Boceprevir (BOC, SCH 503034, MK-3034) in
      combination with Peginterferon Alfa 2-b (PEG) plus Ribavirin (RBV) [PEG+RBV=PR] is effective
      in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1 among the Russian population. The
      primary hypothesis is that the percentage of participants achieving sustained virologic
      response in the BOC + PR group is superior to that in the Placebo (PBO) + PR group.

    <description>SVR24 was defined as an undetectable plasma Hepatitis C Virus-ribonucleic acid (HCV-RNA) level at Follow-up Week 24 (FW24). If a participant was missing FW24 data and had undetectable HCV-RNA at FW12, the participant was considered a sustained virologic responder.</description>
