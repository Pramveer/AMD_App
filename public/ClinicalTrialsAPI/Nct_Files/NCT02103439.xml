      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the noninferiority of Algeron in combination with
      ribavirin compared to PegIntron in combination with ribavirin in treatment of chronic
      hepatitis C in Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 infected patients

    <textblock>
      The course of treatment in both groups shall be 12 weeks, and efficacy analysis, i.e. rate
      of rapid (after the 4th week) and early (after the 12th week) virologic response will be
      based on polymerase chain reaction data. For patients with treatment failure after the 12th
      week the antiviral therapy shall be discontinued. All patients who require further
      anti-viral treatment will receive a combination treatment with Algeron / PegIntron and
      ribavirin for another 36 weeks. Sustained virologic response will be assessed 24 weeks after
      last dose of study treatment.
