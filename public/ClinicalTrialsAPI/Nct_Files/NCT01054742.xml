  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study was to provide summary data from participants who
      relapsed at the end of the follow-up phase after 24 weeks of treatment with standard care
      PegIntron plus ribavirin in Part 1 of the study (NCT00709228) and who then received
      retreatment during Part 2 of the study. Relapse was defined as having a positive virology
      result at the Week 24 post-treatment follow-up, after a negative result at the Week 24
      end-of-treatment time point. Hepatitis C Virus Ribonucleic Acid (HCV-RNA) levels were
      measured at Day 1 and Weeks 12, 24, and 48 of the extension, and at Follow-up Week 24.

      All study activities were consistent with the EU Directive 2001/20/EC section for
      non-interventional studies (i.e. observational studies). Medicinal products are prescribed
      in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the marketing authorization. The
      assignment of the participant to a particular therapeutic strategy is not decided in advance
      by the trial protocol but falls within current practice and the prescription of the medicine
      is clearly separated from the decision to include the patient in the study.
