  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the treatment with
      sofosbuvir (SOF)/velpatasvir (VEL)/GS-9857 fixed dose combination (FDC) ± ribavirin (RBV) in
      participants with chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and prior treatment
      experience with a direct acting antiviral as measured by the proportion of participants with
      sustained viral response 12 weeks after cessation of treatment (SVR12).

    <description>Virologic failure is defined as
On-treatment virologic failure:
HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after having previously had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ while on treatment, confirmed with 2 consecutive values (second confirmation value can be posttreatment), or last available on-treatment measurement with no subsequent follow up values (ie, breakthrough), or
&gt; 1 log10 IU/mL increase in HCV RNA from nadir while on treatment, confirmed with 2 consecutive values (second confirmation value can be posttreatment), or last available on-treatment measurement with no subsequent follow up values (ie, rebound), or
HCV RNA persistently ≥ LLOQ through up to 8 weeks of treatment (ie, nonresponse)
Off-treatment virologic failure:
HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ during the posttreatment period having achieved HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at end of treatment, confirmed with 2 consecutive values or last available posttreatment measurement (ie, relapse)</description>
