    <textblock>
      The objective is to compare the safety and efficacy of the following three treatment
      regimens in previously untreated adult subjects with chronic hepatitis C infected with
      Genotype 1: (1) PegIntron 1.5 µg/kg/wk in combination with weight based REBETOL (800-1400
      mg/day); (2) PegIntron 1µg/kg/wk in combination with weight based REBETOL (800-1400 mg/day);
      and (3) PEGASYS 180 µg/wk plus COPEGUS 1000-1200 mg/day.

      PegIntron Dose will be administered once weekly subcutaneously on the same day of the week:

      Screening 2 Weight 40-50 kg Volume to Inject (mL) 0.22; Screening 2 Weight 51-60 kg Volume
      to Inject (mL) 0.28; Screening 2 Weight 61-75 kg Volume to Inject (mL) 0.33; Screening 2
      Weight 76-85 kg Volume to Inject (mL) 0.41; Screening 2 Weight 86-104 kg Volume to Inject
      (mL) 0.48; Screening 2 Weight 105-125 kg Volume to Inject (mL) 0.58 from two vials

      REBETOL Dosage (for Use With PegIntron):

      Screening 2 Weight 40-65 kg Daily Dose 800 mg; Screening 2 Weight &gt;65-85 kg Daily Dose 1000
      mg; Screening 2 Weight &gt;85-105 kg Daily Dose 1200 mg; Screening 2 Weight &gt;105-125 kg Daily
      Dose 1400 mg

      The PEGASYS dose of 1 mL (180 µg) will be administered once weekly subcutaneously on the
      same day of the week

      COPEGUS Dosage (for Use With PEGASYS):

      Screening 2 Weight &lt;75 kg Daily Dose 1000 mg; Screening 2 Weight &gt; or = 75 kg Daily Dose
      1200mg

      NOTE: Double Blind for PegIntron; Open Label for REBETOL, PEGASYS and COPEGUS

      NOTE: REBETOL is the Schering-Plough brand name for ribavirin. COPEGUS is the Hoffman-La
