  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label, non-randomized, single-arm, multicentre observational study
      is to investigate the influence of the cumulative dose (total administered dose/ planned
      dose) of ribavirin on the sustained virologic response (SVR) in participants who have been
      receiving combination therapy with pegylated interferon alfa-2a (Pegasys) and ribavirin
      (Copegus).
