  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PROVE3 trial is a partially double blinded, randomized, Phase 2 research study of an
      investigational drug, Telaprevir (VX-950) or Placebo, with Pegylated Interferon Alfa 2a
      (Peg-IFN-alfa-2a, Pegasys®), and Ribavirin (RBV, Copegus®) in people with genotype 1
      hepatitis C who have not achieved a Sustained Viral Response (SVR) with a previous treatment
      of interferon therapy.
