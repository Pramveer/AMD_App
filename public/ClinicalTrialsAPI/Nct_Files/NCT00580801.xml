  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the activity and safety of telaprevir on Hepatitis
      C Virus (HCV) Genotype 4, alone or in combination with standard therapy, that is,
      pegylated-interferon-alfa-2a and ribavirin in treatment-naive (never been treated before
      with antiretroviral therapy) participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, partially-blind, randomized (study drug assigned by chance) and
      multiple-dose study to evaluate the activity and safety of telaprevir on HCV early viral
      kinetics in treatment-naive participants who are chronically infected with HCV Genotype 4.
      The study consists of 4 parts: Screening period (6-week); Investigational Treatment period
      (consisting of 2-week treatment with telaprevir or telaprevir+standard treatment or
      placebo); Standard Treatment period (consists of 46 or 48-week standard treatment); and
      Follow-up period (24-week). The activity of telaprevir will be evaluated by early viral
      kinetic parameters along with viral response and pharmacokinetic assessments during the
      investigational treatment phase. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.

    <description>The plasma HCV RNA levels were used to assess the antiviral activity which included viral response as either undetectable HCV RNA (that is no HCV target was detected in the plasma sample) or less than 25 International unit per milliliter (IU/mL) of HCV RNA (that is Plasma sample contained HCV RNA at a concentration below the limit of quantification [LLOQ=25 IU/mL] of the viral load assay). Plasma HCV RNA levels were measured using the COBAS TaqMan HCV test Version 2.0. This assay used real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methodology.</description>
