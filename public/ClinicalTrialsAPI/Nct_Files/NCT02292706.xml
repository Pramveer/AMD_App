      This Registry will enroll cirrhotic participants with or without decompensated liver disease
      who have achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR) after receiving a sofosbuvir
      (SOF)-based regimen without interferon (IFN) while participating in a Gilead-sponsored
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) study or commercially at selected sites. Once enrolled, participants
      will be followed for up to 5 years.

        Participants with cirrhosis who have achieved an SVR after receiving a SOF-based regimen
        without IFN while participating in a Gilead-sponsored HCV study. In addition, participants
        with cirrhosis who have achieved SVR after an all-oral SOF-based regimen outside a
        clinical study may be eligible to enroll in this registry at sites preselected by Gilead.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent

          -  Have either previously participated in a Gilead-sponsored HCV study and received a
             sofosbuvir-containing regimen without interferon OR at pre-selected sites only, have
             received an all-oral SOF-based regimen outside a clinical study. These individuals
             must have documentation of the regimen, start and end of treatment dates (month and
             year), and of having achieved SVR12.

          -  Have achieved SVR either in a Gilead-sponsored study, as defined in the treatment
             protocol OR for individuals who enroll after receiving an all-oral SOF-based regimen
             outside a clinical study, SVR will be defined as HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ approximately 12
             weeks following last dose of treatment.

          -  Have liver cirrhosis, as defined in the treatment protocol, and have not had a liver
             transplant after receiving a SOF-containing regimen OR individuals who enroll after
             receiving an all-oral SOF-based regimen outside a clinical study, will have had
             cirrhosis confirmed prior to initiation of HCV treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals planning to initiate a new course of HCV therapy, including approved
             products and any investigational agents, during the course of this Registry

          -  History of clinically-significant illness or any other major medical disorder that
             may interfere with the follow-up, assessments, or compliance with the protocol
