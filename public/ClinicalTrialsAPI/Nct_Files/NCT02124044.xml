  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health problem with an estimated
      180 million people infected worldwide. In the United States an estimated 4.1 million people
      are infected and HCV is the principal cause of death from liver disease and leading
      indication for liver transplantation. Within HIV/HCV co-infected patients, liver disease due
      to Hepatitis C progresses even more rapidly. While combination of ribavirin (RBV) and
      pegylated interferon (PEG) in combination with boceprevir/telaprevir is the currently
      recommended therapy for chronic HCV infection and has superior cure rates compared to
      PEG+RBV alone in HCV monoinfected patients, treatment is still associated with a high
      incidence of adverse events (AEs), discontinuations and poor cure rates in several
      populations. Within the HIV/HCV co-infected population treatment for HCV remains complicated
      given drug interactions between anti-retrovirals and HCV protease inhibitors, in addition to
      the extensive side-effects due to PEG +RBV alone. Recent studies have demonstrated that the
      use of a combination of anti-virals which target HCV without interferon (IFN) can cure HCV,
      without additional toxicities. These novel therapies that do not rely on an IFN backbone may
      additionally enhance cure rates in HIV/HCV co-infected, a population which has historically
      been difficult to cure.

      This is an open label study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of asunaprevir
      (ASV) 100 mg BID and daclatasvir (DCV) 60 mg daily (selective HCV NS3 and NS5A inhibitors
      respectively) in 20 HIV/HCV co-infected treatment-na(SqrRoot) ve and treatment experienced
      HCV genotype 1b individuals.

      The findings from this study will aid in the understanding of antiviral and host responses
      and determinants of response to an IFN free regimen in HIV/HCV co-infected patients.

        8. Liver biopsy obtained within 36 calendar months prior to the baseline (Day 0) visit to
        verify the presence or absence of cirrhosis, except as indicated below. If no recent (&lt; 36
        months) liver biopsy is available, a liver biopsy may be performed prior to the baseline
        visit.

          1. Cirrhosis is defined as any one of the following:

               1. Any biopsy showing cirrhosis (at any time, not restricted to the 36 calendar
                  months prior to baseline visit).

               2. A FibroSUR[trademark] score, of &gt; 0.75 and an aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
                  platelet ratio index (APRI) of &gt; 2 within the last year.

          2. Absence of cirrhosis is defined as any one of the following:

               1. A liver biopsy performed within 36 calendar months of screening showing absence
                  of cirrhosis.

               2. A FibroSUR[trademark] score, within the last year, of &lt; 0.48 and an APRI of &lt; 1.

                  In the absence of a definitive diagnosis of presence or absence of cirrhosis by
                  the criteria detailed above, a liver biopsy is required. The
                  FibroSURE[trademark]test can be performed and the results can be used to
                  determine the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients with Child Pugh B or C
                  cirrhotics are excluded

             9. Ability to communicate effectively with the study investigator and other key
             personnel.

             10. Willingness to comply with the study restrictions and requirements.

             11. Opioid-dependent individuals must be participating in a supervised treatment
             program.

             12. Subjects must have an external primary care doctor (outside of the Clinical
             Center and the NIH) for their medical management.

             13. Willingness to have blood or tissue samples stored for future use to study liver
             disease and immune function.

             14. Willingness to undergo HLA typing.

             15. Otherwise healthy status as determined by medical history, physical examination,
             electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory measurements performed at screening.

        Contraception

        The effects of ASV and DCV on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, men
        and women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception as outlined
        in the inclusion and exclusion criteria prior to study entry and until 5 weeks (women )
        and 14 weeks (men) after last dose of study medication. Hormonal contraception is NOT
        considered an effective form of birth control for female subjects on this study. Oral
        contraceptives are not as effective in women taking ASV and DCV so women cannot rely on
        this form of birth control to prevent pregnancy. Females of childbearing-age must have a
        negative pregnancy test result prior to receiving ASV and DCV. If a woman becomes pregnant
        or suspects of being pregnant during the course of the study, she should inform the study
        staff and her primary care physician immediately.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Current or prior history of any of the following:

               1. Clinically significant illness (other than HCV) or any other major medical
                  disorder that may interfere with the subject treatment, assessment of compliance
                  with the protocol; subjects currently under evaluation for a
                  clinically-significant illness (other than HCV) are also excluded

               2. Gastrointestinal disorder with post-operative condition that could interfere
                  with the absorption of the study drug

               3. Poor venous access interfering with required study blood collection

             polymorphisms for the 2DAA arm only.

          3. Positive test results at screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen
             (HBsAg) or HBV RNA (completed only if necessary to rule out chronic HBV)

          4. Current use of non-protocol approved ARVs

          5. A new AIDS-defining condition diagnosed within 30 days prior to date screening

               2. Chronic systemic antineoplastic or immunomodulatory treatment including
                  supraphysiologic doses of immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids (e.g.,
