  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a 12-week regimen containing
      simeprevir, daclatasvir and sofosbuvir in participants with decompensated liver disease (the
      liver function is insufficient) due to genotype 1 or 4 Hepatitis (inflammation of the liver)
      C virus (HCV) infection by assessing sustained virologic response 12-weeks after the end of
      study drug treatment (SVR12).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know which treatment the participants receive) Phase 2
      study to investigate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of simeprevir, daclatasvir
      and sofosbuvir in treatment-naive (participants have never received HCV treatment with any
      approved or investigational agent) and treatment - experienced (participants have failed at
      least one previous course of [Pegylated] interferon [(Peg)IFN], with or without Ribavirin)
      participants. Participants will be assigned to 1 of 3 panels: Panel 1 (n=20): Child-Pugh
      score less than (&lt;) 7 with evidence of portal hypertension (confirmed by presence of
      esophageal varices or HVPG greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 10 mm Hg); Panel 2 (n=20):
      Child-Pugh score 7 to 9 (extremes included); and Panel 3 (n=60): Child-Pugh score 7 to 11
      (extremes included), including at least 8 and maximum 20 participants with Child-Pugh score
      10-11. The total study duration for each participant will be approximately 276 weeks. The
      study will consist of 3 parts: Screening Phase (approximately 4 weeks) and open-label
      treatment Phase (from Week 4 to 16) and follow-up Phase (until 5 years for Panel 1 and 2; up
      to 1 year for Panel 3 after the actual end of study drug treatment). Participants will
      receive simeprevir (150 milligram [mg] capsule), daclatasvir (60 mg tablet) and sofosbuvir
      (400 mg tablet) orally once daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy will be primarily evaluated by
      percentage of participants with SVR12. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.
