  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of different
      regimens of TMC435 with standard treatment compared to standard treatment alone in
      participants with chronic, genotype 1, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who has failed
      previous treatment with pegylated interferon (Peg-INF-alfa-2a) and ribavirin (RBV).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician
      nor participant knows the name of the assigned drug), placebo-controlled Phase IIb trial
      with TMC435 in participants with chronic, genotype 1, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who
      have failed standard treatment with pegylated interferon (Peg-INF-alfa-2a) and ribavirin
      (RBV). The study will compare the efficacy, tolerability and safety of different regimens
      with TMC435 combined with standard treatment (Peg-INF-alfa-2a and RBV) versus standard
      treatment alone. The trial will consist of a screening period of maximum 6 weeks, a 48-week
      treatment period, and a 24-week follow-up period. Participants will be eligible to enroll in
      the trial if they failed to respond to a prior course of standard treatment or relapsed
      following standard treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive TMC435 with
      standard treatment for 12 weeks followed by standard treatment (plus placebo) for 36 weeks,
      TMC435 (100 mg or 150 mg once a day) with standard treatment for 24 weeks followed by
      standard treatment (plus placebo) for 24 weeks, TMC435 (100 mg or 150 mg once a day) with
      standard treatment for 48 weeks, or a placebo with standard treatment for 48 weeks.
