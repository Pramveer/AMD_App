      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      ABT-450/ritonavir/ABT-267 (ABT-450/r/ABT-267; ABT-450 also known as paritaprevir; ABT-267
      also known as ombitasvir) and ABT-333 (also known as dasabuvir) coadministered with
      ribavirin (RBV) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1-infected adults taking methadone or
      buprenorphine ± naloxone.

      This study consisted of 2 periods: a 12-week treatment period and a 48-week post-treatment
      period (for all participants who received study drugs). All participants who received at
      least 1 dose of study drug were to be followed for 48 weeks post-treatment to monitor for
      safety, HCV RNA, the emergence and/or persistence of resistant viral variants, and
      assessment of patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Virologic failure during treatment was defined as rebound (confirmed HCV RNA greater than or equal to the lower limit of quantitation [≥ LLOQ] after HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ during treatment, or confirmed increase from the lowest value post baseline in HCV RNA [2 consecutive HCV RNA measurements &gt; 1 log(subscript)10(subscript) IU/mL above the lowest value post baseline] at any time point during treatment) or fail to suppress (HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ) persistently during treatment with at least 6 weeks [≥ 36 days] of treatment.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Participants were considered to have virologic relapse after treatment if they had confirmed quantifiable plasma Hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) ≥ lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) between the end of treatment and 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug among participants who completed treatment with HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at the end of treatment. Completion of treatment was defined as a study drug duration ≥ 77 days.</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve (AUC) for ABT-450, Ritonavir, ABT-267, ABT-333, ABT-333 M1 Metabolite, and Ribavirin</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose (time 0) and 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Blood samples were collected pre-dose (time 0) and at 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours post-dose at one visit between treatment week 2 and treatment week 12, and were analyzed using validated analytical methods. A total of 22/38 participants consented for intensive pharmacokinetic blood sampling. Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC24 in ng*hr/mL)] was estimated using noncompartmental analyses. For ABT-450, ritonavir, and ABT-267, the AUC from time 0 to the last measureable concentration (AUCt in ng*hr/mL) was calculated instead of AUC24 due to time deviations at 24 hours. The AUCt values are approximately equivalent to AUC24. For ABT-333, ABT-333 M1, and RBV, the AUC from time 0 to 12 hours (AUC12 in ng*hr/mL) after the morning dose was calculated using the 24-hour concentration as the 12-hour concentration as dosing was twice a day and a 12-hour sample was not collected in this study.</description>
