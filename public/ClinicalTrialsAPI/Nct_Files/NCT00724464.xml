    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the rates of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) eradication
      and relapse in participants treated with PegIntron and Rebetol in clinical practice in
      Greece. Participants will not be treated as part of the study. Data on participants treated
      in accordance with approved labeling will be collected retrospectively from approximately 30
      sites in Greece.

    <description>SVR was assessed by subgroups based on compliance with the 80/80/80 rule where data was available. 80/80/80 compliant participants were those that received &gt;= 80% of the planned total doses of both pegylated interferon alfa-2b &amp; ribavirin for &gt;=80% of the duration of therapy. 3 rates were to be computed: Compliance with study duration, compliance with pegylated interferon dose, &amp; compliance with ribavirin dose. A participant was defined as compliant, if none of the 3 rates were &lt; than 80%. SVR was defined as undetectable plasma HCV-RNA at 24 weeks after termination of combination treatment.</description>
