    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if pre-liver transplant treatment, using peginterferon
      plus ribavirin, will clear hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA from the blood in HCV-infected
      recipients and reduce the risk of recurrent HCV and allograft hepatitis following liver
      transplant.

    <textblock>
      Patients awaiting deceased donor liver transplant will be asked to enroll in this protocol
      at the time of identification of a potential living liver donor (see note note at end of
      description). Patients randomized to treatment arm will be encouraged to delay living donor
      liver transplant (LDLT) until they have received 12 weeks of treatment to allow for a
      treatment response, if any, to occur. The pros and cons of immediate versus delayed LDLT
      will be discussed with each patient; the timing of LDLT for patients randomized to no
      treatment will be determined by clinical need. There will be separate treatment strategies
      depending upon HCV genotype. Preliminary data and experience strongly suggests that
      interferon-based treatment clears HCV RNA in the majority of patients with genotypes 2 and
      3, even at lower than standard doses (79% on-treatment response and 50% SVR). In contrast,
      clearance rates for genotype 1 patients with advanced cirrhosis may only be 28% on-treatment
      with an 11% SVR. In addition, treatment may be associated with significant side effects,
      intolerance, and increased risk of complications of liver disease. The HCV Committee for
      A2ALL strongly agreed that monitoring safety of pre-transplant antiviral therapy was
      essential and advised inclusion of an untreated control group. For these reasons, all
      patients with HCV, genotypes 1, 4, 5, &amp; 6 infection will be randomized 2:1 to either
      treatment or control (no treatment). Randomization will be web-based to avoid prior
      knowledge of treatment assignment at any site. In contrast to the randomized design for
      patients with genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6, all patients with genotypes 2 and 3 HCV will receive
      treatment. All genotypes will be included in the analysis of safety, tolerance, and
      complications occurring during pre-transplant treatment.

      Treatment is continued up to the time of LDLT or deceased donor liver transplant (DDLT), or
      to a maximum of 48 weeks of continuous treatment. Both peginterferon and ribavirin will be
      stopped if transplantation is expected to occur within 24 hours. Patients whose liver
      disease stabilize and are no longer in need of a liver transplant will complete a full 48
      weeks of treatment with the aim of achieving SVR. These patients will be followed by
      measurement of HCV RNA, biochemical tests, hematology, and clinical evaluation at 3, 6, and
      12 months post-treatment. If relapse occurs when treatment is discontinued after 48 weeks of
      therapy, institution of retreatment will be at the discretion of the investigator.

      Deferral of LDLT while antiviral therapy is continued will be considered in patients who
      have undetectable HCV RNA, tolerate treatment well, lack evidence of HCC or ongoing hepatic
      decompensation, and have had stabilization or improvement in clinical or biochemical
      measures of liver disease: Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) and Model for End-stage Liver Disease
      (MELD) scores. These patients should lack uncontrolled or ongoing bleeding from portal
      hypertension, ascites, systolic blood pressure (SBP), or encephalopathy. The decision to
      defer transplantation and to continue antiviral therapy will be made at the transplant
      center by the clinical investigator in consultation with the patient.

      Based upon the kinetics of early virologic response in the peginterferon + ribavirin
      clinical trials, the researchers anticipate that a minimum of 12 weeks treatment is
      necessary to achieve a virologic response. However, the optimum duration of pre-transplant
      antiviral therapy that yields the highest rates of prevention of post-transplant HCV
      recurrence is unknown. Prolongation of antiviral therapy beyond 12 weeks may be advantageous
      in this regard, but prolonged therapy may also increase the risk of development of
      intercurrent complications of liver disease or side effects of treatment. In addition,
      patients with stable liver disease who achieve virologic remission may experience hepatic
      improvement and avoid transplantation.

      All patients, treated and untreated controls will be followed and tested at the same
      intervals unless specified. Unscheduled visits and additional tests may be performed if
      clinically indicated, the findings at these visits and results of additional tests will be
      recorded in the database. The following details the schedule of visits and the
      tests/procedures to be performed at each visit:

Treatment was initiated with PEGIFN 0.75 µg/kg/week and RBV 600 mg/day. Dose escalations were performed at weeks 1 (PEGIFN 1.5 µg/kg/week and RBV 800 mg/day), 2 (RBV 1.0 g/day), and 3 (RBV 1.2 g/day for patients who weighed more then 75 kg) based upon patient tolerance and weekly blood counts. Once a patient reached the target RBV dose of 1-1.2 g/day (approximately 10.6 to 13.2 mg/kg/day), no further increases in RBV dose were made. Subsequent doses of PEGIFN and RBV were adjusted based upon adverse events, patient tolerability, and blood counts. If the highest tolerated dose of PEGIFN was &lt;0.5 ug/kg, PEGIFN was permanently discontinued.</description>
