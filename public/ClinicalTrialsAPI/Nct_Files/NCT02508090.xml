  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genotype 1 CHC participants from Study SPC3649-207 with null response to prior
      pegylated-interferon alpha plus ribavirin will be enrolled into this 36-month extension
      study, designed to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy after 12 weeks of miravirsen
      monotherapy. Due to the observational nature of the study, miravirsen will not be dosed as
      an investigational product.
