      The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with
      peginterferon alfa-2b 1.0 µg/kg/week subcutaneous (SC) + ribavirin administered for 48 weeks
      in participants with chronic hepatitis C and type C compensated liver cirrhosis.
      Participants who are hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV-RNA) positive after 24 weeks of
      treatment will be discontinued from therapy.
