  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a retrospective data review of medical records from participants
      selected from specialist secondary and tertiary care centers across the United Kingdom (UK),
      specializing in Hepatitis C treatment. The study is non-interventional and is designed to
      identify subgroups of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotype 1 participants in the 'real world',
      including the relation between subgroup characteristics and treatment responsiveness.

      Physicians will record information (from the time of first exposure to pegylated interferon
      alfa-2b and ribavirin) from the medical notes of participants who fit the inclusion
      criteria. To prevent selection bias, data are to be taken from the latest consecutive,
      unique participants seen by the physician over the previous 48 months. This provides a
      method of random sampling from a physician practice.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with genotype 1 HCV infection who have been treated with pegylated
             interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin in the preceding 48 months will be included. They
             will be divided into:

          -  Completer participants: Patients with a diagnosis of HCV genotype 1 who have
             completed a course of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin, with no prior treatment for
             HCV (ie, previously treatment na√Øve). Completer participants must have at least 24
             weeks of follow up data available post completion of treatment to ensure ability to
             assess SVR rates.

          -  Early terminators: Participants who have terminated treatment early due to adverse
             events or other reasons (ie, exposure is incomplete).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants currently undergoing therapy and therefore have not terminated
             treatment, ie, exposure is still ongoing.

          -  Co-infected HCV participants (eg, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] or hepatitis B
             virus [HBV]).

          -  Participants who received their first HCV treatment in relation to a clinical trial.
