  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of PegIntron plus Rebetol
      combination in treating patients with chronic hepatitis C in a primary care setting.
      Patients received no antiviral therapy prior to the current study. Only patients infected
      with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotype 1, 4, 5, or 6 will be enrolled in the study. The study
      will also explore the influence of liver fibrosis stage on the chances of achieving a
      sustained virologic response.
