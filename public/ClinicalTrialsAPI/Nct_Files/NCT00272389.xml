      We hypothesized that pretreatment nonresponder and responder liver tissue would show
      consistent differences in gene expression levels and that these differences could be used to
      predict treatment outcomes and this can obviate the need of the present therapeutic trial.We
      are interested in conducting a retrospective study using the data of patients suffering from
      chronic HCV infection who were treated in our department with a combination of PEGINTERFERON
      and RIBAVIRIN. All these patients underwent liver biopsy prior the treatment. Based on the
      clinical data available it is possible to determine the responders and nonresponders to this
      therapy.RNA will be extracted from the liver tissue and the expression of 5
      genes(IFI15,IFI616,IFI1,OAS3,OAS2 )will be checked .The prediction power of the combination
      of these genes in differentiating responders from nonresponders will be determined.

      Hepatitis C virus is a leading cause of chronic liver disease, with over 170 million people
      infected worldwide. It is also the leading indication for liver transplantation.
      Complications from chronic hepatitis C infection include cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation,
      and hepatocellular carcinoma. As a result, treatment strategies to prevent such
      complications have been widely researched, although many questions remain unanswered. To
      date, the standard therapy for chronic hepatitis C infection is the combination of
      peginterferon and .ribavirin.A large proportion of patients do not respond to therapy for
      reasons that are unclear. The heterogeneity of viral and host phenotypes makes it unlikely
      that any single factor will accurately predict the cellular response to treatment.It was
      supposed that liver tissue of nonresponder and responder show consistent differences in gene
      expression levels and that these differences could be used to predict treatment
      outcomes.Hepatic gene expression profiling identified consistent differences in patients who
      subsequently fail treatment with pegylated IFN-Î± plus ribavirin: up-regulation of a specific
      set of IFN-responsive genes predicts nonresponse to exogenous therapy. These data may be of
      use in predicting clinical responses to treatment. 18 genes, confirmed by real-time PCR,
      with expression levels that differed consistently between nonresponders and responders liver
      tissue were detected. Levels for these 18 genes in responders liver were closer to
      uninfected tissue than to nonresponders liver, with a general up-regulation of gene
      expression in nonresponders liver. Many of these genes are IFN responsive, suggesting that
      the nonresponders patients have adopted a different, yet characteristic, equilibrium in
      their host-virus immune response(Chen L et al. Gastroentology 2005:128:1437-1444) We have
      found a method that can predict success or failure of the treatment of chronic hepatitis C
      based on the weighted expression level of a small number of genes (4-5) We derive the genes
      and their decision weights from the microarray data set obtained from the liver biopsy of
      the patients in the above mentioned paper . We would like to test the prediction power of
      this method in an independent set of liver tissues of treated patients in our department.
