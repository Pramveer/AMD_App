  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, HCV RNA kinetics, and
      other viral characteristics after administration of two arms of MP-424 in combination with
      Peginterferon Alfa 2b (PEG-IFN-a-2b) and Ribavirin (RBV) to patients with chronic hepatitis
      C.
