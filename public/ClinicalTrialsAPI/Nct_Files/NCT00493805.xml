  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3b/4, prospective, open-label, randomized, multicenter study of
      peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin in participants with chronic hepatitis C, genotype 1.
      The study consists of two parts: (1) a noninterventional arm (HOMA IR &lt;= 2) and (2) an
      interventional arm (HOMA IR &gt; 2), where HOMA IR is the insulin resistance index for the
      participants calculated by fasting insulin (uU/mL) x [fasting glucose (mmol/L)/22.5].
      Participants in the noninterventional arm are treated according to the European labeling and
      response rates are evaluated at Month 1 (optional), 3, 6, 12, and follow up. Participants in
      the interventional arm are treated with PEG-Intron 1.5 ug/kg (subcutaneous) once weekly plus
      weight-based REBETOL 800-1400 mg (oral capsules) daily for a variable period depending on
      their response at Week 12: (1) HCV-RNA positive with &lt; 2-log drop in viral load, treatment
      will be discontinued; (2) HCV-RNA positive with &gt;= 2-log drop in viral load; participants
      will be randomized (1:1) to Group A (stop treatment at Week 48) or Group B (stop treatment
      at Week 72); and (3) HCV-RNA negative, treatment will be changed to be according to the
      European labeling and response rates will be evaluated at Month 6, 12, and follow up. All
      participants will go on with their treatment after Week 12 until the results of the HCV
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are available (maximum of 4 weeks).
