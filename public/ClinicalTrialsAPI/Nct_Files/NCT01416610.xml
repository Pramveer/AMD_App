  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multi-center, observational study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a) plus Copegus (ribavirin) in participants with previously
      untreated chronic hepatitis C, genotype 2, 3, 1 or 4, who are undergoing opioid maintenance
      therapy. Data will be collected from eligible participants receiving Pegasys and Copegus
      treatment as prescribed by treating physician and treatment-free follow-up period of 24
      weeks.

    <time_frame>24 weeks after completing treatment, within 3 years, 6 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>SVR24 is defined as percentage of participants with undetectable Hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) 24 weeks after completing treatment, using a last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach. Percentage is based on the number of non-missing observations (total).</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks after completing treatment, within 3 years, 6 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>SVR 12 is defined as percentage of participants with undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after completing treatment, using a LOCF approach. Percentage is based on the number of non-missing observations (total).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With End of Treatment Response</measure>
    <time_frame>at end of treatment, within 3 years, 6 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>A participant was considered to have end of treatment response if there was undetectable HCV RNA after completing treatment, using a LOCF approach. Percentage is based on the number of non-missing observations (total).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Virological Relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>by end of follow-up, within 3 years, 6 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Virological relapse is defined as no SVR24 in a participant with undetectable HCV RNA at end of treatment who has at least one post-treatment polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result available, using a LOCF approach. Percentage is based on the number of non-missing observations (total).</description>

    <measure>Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Scores by Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, week 12, end of treatment and end of follow-up within 3 years, 6 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The SF-36 questionnaire items were scored and transformed according to the SF-36 Health Survey Manual &amp; Interpretation Guide. Summary scores for SF-36 dimensions of physical functioning, role functioning, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, and mental health were scored on a scale of 0 (worst) to 100 (best), and health transition was scored on a scale of 0 (worst) to 5 (best). Summary SF-36 scores are reported by category and by visit.</description>

    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) Score by Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, week 12, end of treatment and end of follow-up within 3 years, 6 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) consists of 9 questions, each answered within a range of 1-7, where lower scores indicate less fatigue in everyday life. The FSS score is the mean of the 9 numbers. Mean scores are presented by visit.</description>

    <measure>Beschwerdeliste (BL) Score by Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, week 12, end of treatment and end of follow-up within 3 years, 6 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The BL questionnaire items were scored by calculating the average response to all answered items. Items can be graded 1=&quot;stark&quot; (affliction is strong) to 4=&quot;gar nicht&quot; (not present). The higher the BL score, the less afflictions were present for a participant. Mean scores are presented by visit.</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) Score by Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, week 12, end of treatment and end of follow-up within 3 years, 6 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The BDI questionnaire items were scored by generating the sum of the responses to all answered items. Each result was categorized into one of four categories: 0-13= no depression or clinically not significant or in remission; 14-19= mild depression; 20-28= moderate depression; or 29-63= severe depression. Mean scores are presented by visit.</description>
