  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter, national observational study will investigate the
      effectiveness of standard of care treatment with PEGASYS in patients with chronic hepatitis
      B (CHB). Patients who have never received any hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatment and patients
      previously treated with nucleos(t)ide analogs are qualified for enrollment. The observation
      period is 48 weeks (PEGASYS standard of care treatment) and for up to 24 weeks thereafter
      (72 weeks in total).

        Adult patients receiving treatment for chronic hepatitis B with PEGASYS according to
        standard of care and in line with the current summary of product characteristics and local

        population are naïve subjects (who have never received any hepatitis B virus treatment)
        and previously treated subjects with nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs).
