  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the technical feasibility of using fine needle aspiration (FNA) of
      liver tissue to obtain vaniprevir (MK-7009) liver pharmacokinetic (PK) data, working towards
      identifying a minimally invasive, reproducible platform to measure liver PK. The study will
      be done in 2 parts. In Part 1, participants will be randomized to one of five FNA/core
      needle biopsy (CNB) time-point collection sequences. In Part 2, participants will be
      randomized to one of two possible doses of vaniprevir and will be assigned to one of five
      FNA/CNB time-point collection sequences; participants in Part 2 will also receive background
      therapy with pegylated interferon alpha-2b (Peg-IFN alpha-2b) and ribavirin (RBV). The
      primary hypothesis is that there is a greater than 80% posterior probability that vaniprevir
      concentrations are successfully obtained at least 60% of the time from FNA liver samples
      collected at 2 of 3 specified timepoints.
