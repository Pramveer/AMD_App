      This study is to evaluate the antiviral efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) fixed-dose combination (FDC) in adults with nosocomial
      genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

    <description>Virologic failure was defined as
On-treatment virologic failure:
Breakthrough (confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after having previously had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ while on treatment), or
Rebound (confirmed &gt; 1 log10 IU/mL increase in HCV RNA from nadir while on treatment), or
Non-response (HCV RNA persistently ≥ LLOQ through 8 weeks of treatment)
Virologic relapse:
Confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ during the posttreatment period having achieved HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at last on-treatment visit.</description>
