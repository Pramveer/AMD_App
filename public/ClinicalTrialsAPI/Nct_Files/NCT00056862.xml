  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effectiveness of low-dose peginterferon and ribavirin therapy
      for certain patients with chronic hepatitis C-a liver disease that, in some patients, can
      progress to cirrhosis of the liver, liver cancer, and liver failure.

    <textblock>
      Sixty patients with chronic hepatitis C infected with HCV genotype 2 or 3 will be treated
      using the combination of either low- or standard dose peginterferon and ribavirin for 24
      weeks, with re-treatment using the standard doses and a longer duration (48 weeks) for those
      who do not respond to or relapse after initial low dose therapy.

      Adult patients with chronic hepatitis C who have HCV genotype 2 or 3 and previously have not
      received anti-viral treatment will be given peginterferon alfa-2a (90 or 180 micrograms
      weekly by injection) and ribavirin (800 mg daily by mouth). Patients will be monitored at 2-
      to 4-week intervals for side effects, compliance, complete blood counts, liver biochemical
      tests and HCV RNA. Patients becoming HCV RNA negative by week 12 will be considered
      on-treatment responders, continue therapy to week 24, and be monitored thereafter for
      another 24 weeks. Patients who do not become HCV RNA negative by week 12 as well as patients
      who relapse after therapy will be retreated with 180 micrograms of peginterferon weekly and
      800 mg of ribavirin for another 48 weeks.

      The primary outcome will be sustained loss of HCV RNA at 24 weeks after low- or
      standard-dose combination therapy. Secondary outcomes include viral kinetics and side
      effects. Because of preliminary results in the initial 31 patients enrolled in this study,
      the dose of peginterferon was changed from 90 to 180 micrograms weekly for the remaining 29
      patients to be enrolled, allowing for a direct comparison of efficacy, viral kinetics and
      side effects of standard- vs low-dose peginterferon therapy.

      This study will evaluate the relative efficacy and safety of the standard versus lower doses
      of peginterferon with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C and HCV genotype 2 or
      3.
