    <description>AUC(INF) was estimated by summing the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration and the extrapolated area, computed by the quotient of the last observable concentration and elimination rate constant. The pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis was based on Cockcroft-Gault (C-G) creatinine clearance (CLcr) grouping method: normal renal function, end stage renal disease (ESRD), moderate and severe renal impairment. Mild participants were counted as per their original allocation.</description>
