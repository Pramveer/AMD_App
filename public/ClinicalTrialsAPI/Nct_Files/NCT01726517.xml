  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antiviral efficacy of
      ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) fixed-dose combination (FDC) with or without ribavirin
      (RBV), administered for 8 or 12 weeks of treatment in participants with chronic genotype 1
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who are treatment-naive, and for 12 weeks in participants
      who had previously received a regimen containing a protease inhibitor for the treatment of
      HCV.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>SVR12 was defined as HCV RNA &lt; the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ; ie, 25 IU/mL) 12 weeks after stopping study treatment.</description>

    <description>The number of participants experiencing an adverse event leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug(s) was summarized.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With SVR at 2, 4, 8, and 24 Weeks After Discontinuation of Therapy (SVR2, SVR4, SVR8, and SVR24)</measure>
    <time_frame>Posttreatment Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 24</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>SVR2, SVR4, SVR8, and SVR24 was defined as HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at 2, 4, 8, and 24 weeks following the last dose of study drug, respectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Experiencing Viral Breakthrough or Viral Relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Posttreatment Week 24</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Viral breakthrough was defined as HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after having previously had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ while receiving treatment, confirmed with 2 consecutive values (second confirmation value could be posttreatment), or last available on-treatment measurement with no subsequent follow-up values.
Viral relapse was defined as HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ during the posttreatment period having achieved HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at end of treatment, confirmed with 2 consecutive values or last available posttreatment measurement.</description>
