  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of peginterferon alfa-2b (PegIFN
      alfa-2b) as adjuvant treatment in Japanese participants with malignant melanoma after
      definitive surgical resection including complete lymphadenectomy. Participants on this study
      will initially receive PegIFN alfa-2b for 8 weeks (Induction Phase) and then may continue to
      receive PegIFN alfa-2b (Maintenance Phase) as long as they are experiencing clinical
      benefit.
