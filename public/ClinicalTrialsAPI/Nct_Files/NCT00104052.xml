    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the safety, efficacy and tolerability of the combination
      of PEG-Intron plus REBETOL in pediatric subjects with chronic hepatitis C. The secondary
      objective is to measure the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of PEG-Intron and REBETOL in
      pediatric subjects with chronic hepatitis C.

      This global, multicenter, open-label Phase 3 study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and
      tolerability of PEG-Intron plus REBETOL in previously untreated pediatric subjects, ages 3
      through 17 years, with chronic hepatitis C.
