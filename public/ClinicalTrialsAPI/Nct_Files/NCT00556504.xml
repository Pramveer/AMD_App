  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of TCM-700C as an
      add-on treatment to the combination drug therapy (Peginterferon α-2b plus Ribavirin) for
      patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C infections. This will be demonstrated by a
      higher sustained virologic response rate, defined as the absence of detectable HCV RNA 24
      weeks after the termination of combinational drug treatment, compared with the placebo
      add-on.

      This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, Phase 2 study to
      evaluate the effects of adding a Chinese formulation (TCM-700C) on the standard combination
      treatment for patients with Genotype 1 hepatitis C infection. Patients were screened within
      4 weeks before receive the first study drug dose. Eligible patients at baseline were
      stratified according to baseline HCV RNA (≤800,000 IU/ml vs &gt;800,000 IU/ml) and randomized
      with an equal chance to receive either TCM-700C or placebo as an add-on to the combination
      drug therapy. The combination drug therapy was peginterferon α-2b (PEG-INTRON®,
      Schering-Plough) 1.5 micrograms/kg once weekly injection for 48 weeks plus oral ribavirin
      (REBETOL®, Shering-Plough) 1000mg-1200mg daily for 48 weeks. The add-on treatment of
      TCM-700C or placebo was given 2 tablets thrice daily for 48 weeks.

      During the 48 week treatment period and 24 week untreated follow-up, patients were assessed
      at regular intervals for safety and efficacy at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and then every 8 weeks
      thereafter until study completion. Patients who prematurely discontinued test drug therapy
      had laboratory examination re-taken on the week patient was discontinued from study.

    <description>SVR is defined as no detectable HCV RNA in serum of patient at Week 72, which is 24 weeks after the termination of combination drug treatment..
A subject is a sustained responder at a given week, if the subject has negative HCV RNA at that week and all the subsequent weeks through Week 72.
If a patient has a missing value between visits, then the last non-missing HCV RNA is carried forward to fill in the missing value.
If the patient's HCV RNA at last visit, Week 72 is missing or above the limit of detection, then the patient is a non-responder, even if all the previous visits from baseline onwards were undetectable.
Serum HCV RNA will be tested using a commercially available real-time polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay kit (Roche Cobas TaqMan HCV assay kit)</description>
