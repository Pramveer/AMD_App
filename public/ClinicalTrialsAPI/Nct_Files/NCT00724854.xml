    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate, in each group, the number of participants who
      achieve rapid virological response (RVR) after 4 weeks treatment with PegIntron and Rebetol.
      The study will also assess whether RVR is a reliable predictor of sustained virologic
      response (defined as undetectable viral load at 24 weeks post-treatment).
