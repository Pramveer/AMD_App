      Background:

      - Treatment for Hepatitis C has changed a lot in the past 2 years. Most of this change comes
      from a combination of medicines that is yielding high cure rates. But its long-term effects
      are uncertain. One problem is that a lot of people need the treatment, but only a few
      specialists can give it. The success rate for Hepatitis C treatment by primary care doctors,
      nurse practitioners, or physician assistants is largely unknown. Researchers want to see how
      provider type affects treatment outcomes. They will conduct a large, community-based study
      in the District of Columbia.

      Objectives:

      - To see if people can be treated for Hepatitis C safely and successfully in community-based
      health centers.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults who need treatment for chronic Hepatitis C infection.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with blood tests. Their current medicines will be
           reviewed.

        -  Participants will give researchers access to their medical records. Researchers will
           follow participants through these records.

        -  Participants will see a primary care or infectious disease provider. The provider will
           tell them about their treatment. They will be told how often they will visit the
           provider and how often they will have their blood drawn. They will get a calendar of
           study visits.

        -  Participants will take Harvoni for 8, 12, or 24 weeks. They will visit their care
           provider monthly.

        -  Participants will have monthly follow-up visits for up to 3 months after they finish
           their medicine.

        -  Participants will have yearly follow-up visits with their care provider for up to 10
           years.

    <textblock>
      Treatment for hepatitis C has been revolutionized in the last 2 years with the advent of
      combination antiviral therapy yielding high cure rates; although, the long term effects of
      treatment remain uncertain. Use of these medications has been limited to clinical trial
      settings typically by highly specialized care teams in tertiary care hospitals. As the
      prevalence of hepatitis C is significant, there exists a significant imbalance between
      patients who require treatment and specialists who provide treatment. Success rates in
      treatment of hepatitis C by primary care doctors or physician extenders, such as nurse
      practitioners or physician assistants, is largely unknown.

      As such, we propose the first community-based, large scale, longitudinal study of directly
      acting antiviral (DAA)-based treatment for chronic hepatitis C, set in the District of
      Columbia. Within this study, approximately 600 HCV genotype 1 monoinfected and HCV/HIV
      coinfected subjects will be treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (90 mg/400 mg) fixed dosed
      combination for 8-24 weeks, based on the medication labeling instructions, and followed for
      both immediate (SVR12) and long term (comorbid disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma,
      transplantation and mortality) outcomes over a 10 year study period. The study will be
      conducted exclusively in the District of Columbia clinics associated with the NIH DC
      Partnership for AIDS/HIV Progress (DC PFAP), which serves a population comprised primarily
      of minorities, with a high degree of negative predictors of treatment response. In this
      study, participants will be assigned to treatment either by (1) an ID or hepatology
      specialist, (2) primary care provider, or (3) physician extender. Please see Figure 1 study
      schema for an approximate distribution of subjects. Each of these provider groups will
      undergo uniform training on treatment of hepatitis C and management of adverse events prior
      to initiation of study. All subjects will sign informed consent and agree to treatment and
      follow up phases of the study. During the course of the study, subjcts will be clinically
      evaluated based on American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)/ the
      Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the management of hepatitis C.
      Clinical data from subjects will be captured in a city wide cohort database, which will
      store guideline-driven data points from each clinic visit within the network.

      Through this trial we will explore the efficacy of managing hepatitis C subjects with
      directly acting antiviral therapy in an urban, community-based setting, and investigate the
      effect of provider type (specialist, primary care, or physician extender) on treatment
      outcome. We will detail the safety and tolerability of this treatment. We will assess
      variability in treatment outcomes between monoinfected and HIV-coinfected subjects. Finally,
      we will evaluate the public health impact of large-scale treatment of HCV infected subjects
      in preventing long-term clinical outcomes. As the first interferon (IFN)- and ribavirin
      (RBV)-free, urban community-based treatment utilizing new standard of care criteria, this
      study will serve as a model for implementation of similar practice patterns globally.
