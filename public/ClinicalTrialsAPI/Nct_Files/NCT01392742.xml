  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will evaluate predictors of early on-treatment response and
      sustained virological response in patients with chronic hepatitis C receiving Pegasys
      (peginterferon alfa-2a) and ribavirin. Data will be collected from patients on treatment (24
      or 48 weeks) and 24 weeks after the end of treatment.

    <description>SVR was defined as undetectable Hepatitis C Virus Ribonucleic Acid (HCV RNA) 24 weeks after completion of the actual treatment period (a single last undetectable HCV RNA Polymerase Chain Reaction [PCR] measured greater than or equal to &gt;=140 days post-treatment).</description>

    <description>Relapse was define as аn undetectable HCV RNA during the treatment period, but without such during the follow-up.</description>

    <description>Predictive value determined the relationship of the virological response at specified time to the total response. Positive predicted value= number of true positives/(number of true positives+ number of false positives). SVR was defined as undetectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after end of treatment. Percentage of participants who showed positive predictive value in treatment naive and those who failed previous treatment with interferon were reported.</description>

    <description>Predictive value determined the relationship of the virological response at specified time to the total response. Positive predicted value= number of true positives/( number of true positives+ number of false positives). SVR was defined as undetectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after end of treatment.

    <description>Correlation of SVR with RVR was based on 3 symmetric measures; Kendall's tau-b, Kendall's tau-c and Gamma. SVR was defined as undetectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after end of treatment. RVR was defined as having undetectable HCV RNA 4 weeks after start of treatment.</description>

    <description>Correlation of SVR with EVR was based on 3 symmetric measures; Kendall's tau-b, Kendall's tau-c and Gamma. SVR was defined as undetectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after end of treatment. EVR was defined as having undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after start of treatment.</description>

    <description>Predictive value determined the relationship of host factors to virological response. Host factors included; RVR (EVR for Week 12), gender, liver fibrosis, HCV genotype, height and treatment duration for Week 4 after EOT excluding HCV genotype at Week 12 EOT. RVR was defined as having undetectable HCV RNA 4 weeks after start of treatment and EVR was defined as having undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after start of treatment.</description>

    <description>The Virological response at the end of treatment was defined as the percentage of participants with undetectable HCV RNA, HCV test (based on a single last undetectable HCV RNA PCR falling in the 4 weeks' time window at end of treatment), is basically the sum of participants with SVR and with relapse.</description>
