  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness and safety of TMC435 compared
      with placebo in participants who are infected with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus who have
      never received treatment before. Participants will also receive peginterferon alfa-2a or
      peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin as part of their treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind (neither physician or participant knows the name of the
      assigned drug), placebo-controlled study of TMC435 in participants who are infected with
      genotype 1 hepatitis C virus who have never received treatment for this before. Participants
      in this study will also receive two other drugs for their infection (either peginterferon
      alfa-2a (Pegasys®) and ribavirin (Copegus®) or peginterferon alfa-2b (PegIntron®) and
      ribavirin (Rebetol®). The purpose of the study is to investigate if TMC435 is superior to
      placebo in reducing hepatitis C virus to an undetectable level 24 weeks after the end of
      treatment. For the first 12 weeks, participants will take TMC435 or placebo, plus
      peginterferon and ribavirin. For the next 12 weeks, participants will take peginterferon and
      ribavirin only. After that, some participants will continue to take peginterferon and
      ribavirin for up to 24 additional weeks. Other participants will stop taking peginterferon
      and ribavirin. The study doctor will inform each participant about how to take their study
      medication and when they should stop taking it. After a participant stops taking study
      medication, they will continue to come to the doctor's office for study visits until a total
      of 72 weeks after they enroll in the study. The total duration of the study is 78 weeks
      (including screening). Participants will be monitored for safety throughout the study. Study
      assessments at each study visit may include but are not limited to: blood and urine
      collection for testing, electrocardiogram (ECG) assessments (a measurement of the electrical
      activity of your heart), participant questionnaires, and physical examinations. TMC435 will
      be taken as an oral capsule of 150 mg once per day. Peginterferon (Pegasys ®) will be given
      as an injection of 180 µg once each week. Peginterferon (PegIntron®) will be given as an
      injection once each week and the dose will depend on your body weight. Ribavirin will be
      taken as a tablet (Copegus ®) or a capsule (Rebetol ®) twice each day and the dose will
      depend on your body weight.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Study participants completed FSS questionnaires during study visits before treatment and throughout follow-up to rate the severity and impact of fatigue experienced in the preceding 2 weeks. FSS total scores are the average of nine questions with a range from 1 [no fatigue] to 7 [worst fatigue]; the possible score range from baseline to Week 60 would be 60-420 and to Week 72 would be 72-504. The average FSS total score from baseline to Week 60 and to Week 72 was calculated for each participant and then the average of those values were calculated to show the average FSS total score for each treatment group. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference between the treatment arms in the FSS total score. The Table below shows the lease squares (LS) mean estimates of the area under the curve (AUC) at Week 72 (as well as at Week 60) and the statistical comparison between treatment groups.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Impairment in overall work productivity was measured using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI): Hepatitis C questionnaire completed by participants throughout the study. WPAI Overall Productivity Scores ranged from 0% to 100% (higher WPAI scores indicated greater impairment in productivity). The average WPAI score from baseline to Week 72 was calculated for each participant and then the average of those values were calculated to show the average WPAI score for each treatment group. The null hypothesis was there is no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups in the AUC for the change from baseline to Week 72 (AUC72) in WPAI Productivity Scores. The Table below shows WPAI Productivity Scores at Week 72 (as well as at Week 60) from the model used to calculate the AUC and the statistical comparison between treatment groups.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Impairment in daily activity was measured using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI): Hepatitis C questionnaire, Question 6. The possible impairment in WPAI daily activity score range from baseline to Week 60 was 0-6000 and to Week 72 was 0-7200, with the higher scores indicating more impairment in daily activities. The average WPAI impairment in daily activity score from baseline to Week 72 was calculated for each participant and then the average of those values were calculated to show the average WPAI impairment in daily activity score for each treatment group. The null hypothesis was there is no statistically significant difference between the treatment arms in the AUC for the change from baseline to Week 72 (AUC72) in WPAI impairment in daily activity scores. The Table below shows the WPAI Impairment in daily activity scores at Week 72 (as well as at Week 60) and the statistical analysis between treatment groups.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Hours missed from work because of HCV infection or its treatment was assessed by measuring the change from baseline in the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI): Hepatitis C questionnaire Absenteeism score (time missed from work). The possible WPAI WPAI absenteeism score range from baseline to Week 60 was 0-6000 and to Week 72 was 0-7200, with the higher scores indicating more impairment in WPAI absenteeism. The average WPAI absenteeism score from baseline to Week 60/72 was calculated for each participant and then the average of those values calculated for each treatment group. The area under the curve (AUC60/AUC72) over time from baseline to Week 60/72 was derived from a piecewise-linear model allowing the slopes to change at Week 4, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60. The null hypothesis was there is no statistically significant difference between the treatment arms in the area under the curve (AUC) from baseline to Week 72 (AUC72) in WPAI absenteeism score.</description>
