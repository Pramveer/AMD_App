  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical trial is to determine whether long-term oral dosage of
      ribavirin delays development of symptomatic HIV disease in HIV antibody positive subjects
      who are completely asymptomatic (CDC classification group II), who have only the
      lymphadenopathy syndrome (CDC classification group III), or who have clinical symptoms but
      not severe HIV disease as defined by CDC classification, and whether the dosage regimen is
      safe and tolerable in these subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Concurrent Medication:

        Allowed:

          -  Acyclovir.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Co-existing Condition:

        Patients with the following symptoms and conditions are excluded:

          -  CDC classification group IV A (ARC).

          -  CDC classification group IV C-1 (AIDS) and IV C-2 (including Thrush or Herpes zoster
             during the past 2 years). Positive plasma p24 antigen.

          -  Unstable medical condition, including serious cardiovascular, renal, hepatic,
             neurologic, infectious, or oncologic condition even if unrelated to HIV infection.

          -  Splenectomy.

        Concurrent Medication:

        Excluded:

          -  Isoprinosine.

        Patients with the following are excluded:

          -  Failure to give informed consent.

          -  CDC classification group IV A (ARC).

          -  CDC classification group IV C-1 (AIDS) and IV C-2 (including Thrush or Herpes zoster
             during the past 2 years).

        Positive plasma p24 antigen.

          -  Unstable medical condition, including serious cardiovascular, renal, hepatic,
             neurologic, infectious, or oncologic condition even if unrelated to HIV infection.

          -  Splenectomy.

        Prior Medication:

        Excluded within 4 weeks of start of screening tests:

          -  Zidovudine.

          -  Other drug with scientifically accepted anti-HIV properties.

          -  Scientifically accepted immunostimulant treatment.

          -  Immunosuppressant.

          -  Myelosuppressant or other known toxic drugs.

        HIV infection group II (CDC), asymptomatic HIV infection.

          -  HIV antibody positive by Western blot with antibodies to p24 band and GP160 band
             and/or GP41. Two positive tests during screening will be required. CDC HIV infection
             group II, asymptomatic HIV infection, as defined in Appendix A, or CDC HIV infection
             group III, persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL, formerly LAS).

          -  OKT4+ lymphocyte count greater than 300 cells/mm3 and less than 600 cells/mm3. The
             counts will be determined on three separate evaluations separated by at least 7 days
             between evaluations. These three counts will be averaged and for inclusion in the
             study the mean of the OKT4+ lymphocyte count must be greater than 200 cells/mm3 and
             less than 600 cells/mm3. Conclusion of screening tests:

          -  Within 42 days of starting them. Patients must be entered into the study within 14
             days of screening completion. Ability to participate as outpatient:

          -  Ambulatory, competent to sign informed consent, and able to cooperate with the
             treatment plan and evaluation schedule. Informed consent:

          -  Must be signed before randomization to treatment. Physical activity evaluation with
             Karnofsky score greater than or equal to 90.
