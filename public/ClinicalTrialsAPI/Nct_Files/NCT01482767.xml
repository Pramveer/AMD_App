    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of death and illness in people with
      HIV-1. Currently, the standard treatment for people with HIV-1 and HCV coinfection includes
      two drugsâ€”pegylated-interferon alfa 2b (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV). The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the effectiveness of giving boceprevir (BOC) together with standard
      treatment in treating HCV infection in people with HIV-1 and HCV coinfection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For HIV-1-infected individuals, HCV infection is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality,
      and the prevalence of HCV infection is higher among those infected with HIV-1. The current
      standard-of-care (SOC) therapy for HCV infection is treatment with both PEG-IFN and RBV.
      This therapy is 40%-45% effective in patients with HCV infection but is significantly less
      effective in patients with both HCV and HIV-1. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of
      adding BOC, a novel HCV protease inhibitor, to SOC therapy in treating HCV infection
      (genotype 1) in HCV/HIV-1-coinfected adults.

      Participants will be assigned to one of two groups based on previous HCV treatment. Group A
      will include HCV treatment-naive participants who have never received treatment with PEG-IFN
      or experimental agents used to treat HCV, with or without RBV. Group B will include HCV
      treatment-experienced participants who have received any treatment with standard interferon
      or with PEG-IFN with or without RBV, provided the last dose of treatment was 90 days or more
      before study entry. All participants should be on stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at
      least 8 weeks prior to study entry using a dual nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor (NRTI) backbone plus one of the following: efavirenz (EFV), raltegravir (RAL),
      lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir (RTV) 400/100 mg twice daily, atazanavir (ATV)/RTV, darunavir
      (DRV)/RTV 600/100 mg twice daily OR not have received any ART for at least 4 weeks
      immediately prior to entry. Participation in this study will last approximately 72 weeks.

      GROUP A (HCV Treatment-Naive)

      STEP 1:

      Lead In

      Participants will receive PEG-IFN subcutaneously (SC) once weekly and oral RBV daily for the
      first 4 weeks.

      Triple Therapy

      Participants will receive PEG-IFN SC once weekly, oral RBV daily, and oral BOC every 8 hours
      for an additional 24 weeks.

      At Week 28, after completion of Step 1, Group A participants with undetectable HCV RNA at
      Week 8 and without cirrhosis at study screening will discontinue study treatment;
      participants with detectable or missing viral HCV viral load at Week 8 will continue to Step
      2.

      All study drugs must be stopped if HCV RNA is 100 international units (IU)/mL or greater at
      Week 12 or detectable at Week 24 or there is a confirmed increase to more than 1000 IU/mL at
      any time after Week 12.

      STEP 2:

      Participants without cirrhosis at study screening:

      Participants will receive PEG-IFN SC once weekly, oral RBV daily, and oral BOC every 8 hours
      for an additional 8 weeks (to Week 36) followed by PEG-IFN SC once weekly plus oral RBV
      daily for 12 weeks (to Week 48).

      Participants with cirrhosis at study screening:

      Participants will receive PEG-IFN SC once weekly, oral RBV daily, and oral BOC every 8 hours
      for an additional 20 weeks (to Week 48).

      GROUP B (HCV Treatment-Experienced)

      All participants will receive PEG-IFN SC once weekly and oral RBV daily for the first 4
      weeks.

      Participants without cirrhosis at study screening will then receive PEG-IFN SC once weekly,
      oral RBV daily, and oral BOC every 8 hours for 32 weeks (to Week 36); followed by PEG-IFN SC
      once weekly and oral RBV daily for 12 weeks (to Week 48).

      Participants with cirrhosis at study screening will receive triple therapy for 44 weeks
      (Week 5 to Week 48).

      All participants will have study visits at screening and at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16,
      20, and 24. Select participants may also have study visits on Weeks 28, 40, 52, 60, and 72
      or at Weeks 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 60, and 72. At each visit, participants will undergo a
      physical examination and blood collection. Participants will also complete an HCV treatment
      adherence questionnaire. At select visits, participants will undergo urine collection and
      pregnancy testing (for women of reproductive potential). Plasma, serum, and peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be stored for use in future studies.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria (Groups A and B):

          -  Men and women 18 years of age or older

          -  Presence of chronic HCV infection, defined by presence of plasma or serum HCV RNA in
             a participant with HCV antibody for at least 180 days, two documented HCV RNA
             positive results greater than 180 days apart, or positive HCV RNA with biopsy
             demonstrating chronic hepatitis. More information on this criterion can be found in
             the protocol.

          -  Serum or plasma HCV RNA level 10,000 IU/mL or greater obtained within 42 days prior
             to study entry by any laboratory that has a Clinical Laboratory Improvement
             Amendments (CLIA) certification or its equivalent. NOTE: This must be a quantitative
             HCV RNA test, not a qualitative HCV RNA test.

          -  Screening HCV genotype 1 performed within 6 months prior to study entry from a
             College of American Pathologists (CAP)/CLIA-approved laboratory. Screening genotype
             test MUST BE performed locally; ONLY IF IT IS NOT AVAILABLE LOCALLY can it be done at
             the designated virology specialty laboratory (VSL) (see A5294 Laboratory Processing
             Chart [LPC] in protocol).

          -  Liver biopsy or HCV FibroSUREâ„¢ test within 104 weeks prior to study entry with
             interpretation consistent with chronic HCV infection. If a liver biopsy HCV
             FibroSUREâ„¢ test has not been performed within 104 weeks prior to study entry, then
             either a biopsy or HCV FibroSUREâ„¢ test must be obtained prior to enrollment. The
             cut-off value for the FibroSUREâ„¢ test is 0.74, where greater than 0.74 is interpreted
             as cirrhosis. More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol.

          -  Participants should have alpha feto protein (AFP) levels less than 50. If 50 or
             greater, they should have a liver imaging study (e.g., ultrasound, computed
             tomography [CT] scan, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] showing no evidence of
             hepatocellular carcinoma.

          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, by HIV-1 p24 antigen, or by plasma HIV-1 RNA
             viral load. More information on this criterion can be found in the protocol.

          -  Currently not on any antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at least 4 weeks immediately
             prior to entry or on stable ART for at least 8 weeks prior to study entry using a
             dual NRTI backbone PLUS one of the following: EFV, RAL, LPV/RTV 400/100 mg twice
             daily, ATV/RTV, DRV/RTV 600/100 mg twice daily. Breaks in therapy for a maximum of 14
             days will be allowed. Dose modifications or changes in drugs during the 8 weeks prior
             to study entry are permitted unless the change in drug was due to treatment failure.
             Participants not on ART should have no plans to initiate therapy during the first 24
             weeks after study entry. Participants on ART should plan to remain on the same
             therapy for at least 12 weeks after study entry. More information on this criterion
             can be found in the protocol.

          -  CD4+ T-cell count greater than 200 cells/mm^3 obtained within 42 days prior to study

             certification or its equivalent. For participants who are not on ART, plasma HIV-1
             RNA less than 50,000 copies/mL obtained within 42 days prior to study entry by any
             FDA-approved test for quantifying HIV-1 RNA at any laboratory that has a CLIA
             certification or its equivalent.
