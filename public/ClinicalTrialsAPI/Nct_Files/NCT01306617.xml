    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antiviral activity, safety, and
      pharmacokinetics of ABT-450 with ritonavir (ABT-450/r) dosed in combination with ABT-333
      (also known as dasabuvir) and ribavirin (RBV) in treatment-naïve and non responder
      participants with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

    <textblock>
      This was a phase 2a multicenter, open-label, sequential, 3-arm, combination treatment study
      of a regimen of ABT-450/r/ABT-333, and ribavirin (RBV) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype
      1-infected treatment-naïve participants and previous non-responders to pegylated interferon
      (pegIFN)/RBV treatment.

    <description>Baseline samples were analyzed for resistance-associated amino acid variants using population sequencing. Phenotypic resistance to ABT-450 or ABT-333 at baseline was assessed by calculating the fold difference in the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) compared with the EC50 for the appropriate reference replicon (1a-H77 or 1b-Con1). Participants not achieving SVR12 were analyzed for resistance-associated variants at the time of failure using population sequencing and were compared with the baseline and appropriate reference sequences to assess amino acid changes. Phenotypic resistance to ABT-450 or ABT-333 at the time of failure was assessed by calculating the fold difference in the EC50 compared with the EC50 for the corresponding baseline sample. The number of participants with variants at resistance-associated amino acid positions and phenotypic resistance at baseline and at the time of failure are presented.</description>
