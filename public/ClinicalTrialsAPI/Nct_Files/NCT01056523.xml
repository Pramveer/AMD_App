  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of ribavirin, when given
      in combination with low-dose ara-C and to determine if it is safe and well-tolerated in
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

      Primary Objectives

      In the Phase I portion of this study, we will determine the maximum tolerated dose and
      recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of ribavirin and low-dose ara-C. The primary objective of
      the Phase II portion of the study is to determine the overall response rate, including the
      complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi),
      partial remission (PR) or blast response (BR), to therapy with ribavirin and low dose ara-C
      at the RP2D.

      STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION

      This is a multicentre, open-label, single arm Phase I/II study of oral ribavirin and
      low-dose ara-C for patients with AML M4/M5 or AML with high expression of eIF4E, who have
      relapsed or refractory disease, or who are not suitable candidates for induction
      chemotherapy. This study will determine the recommended phase II dose and will evaluate
      efficacy. Correlative studies will be included to assess relevant molecular targets.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The following patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are eligible:

               -  De novo AML M4 or M5 FAB subtype or high eIF4E.

               -  Secondary AML after a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or a myeloproliferative
                  disorder (not chronic myelogenous leukemia), if M4 or M5 FAB subtype or high

             chemotherapies), have relapsed, or are not suitable candidates for intensive
             induction chemotherapy.

          -  Patients who have a dry aspirate or extramedullary disease only are eligible for this
             study if they have a pre-treatment marrow or tissue biopsy demonstrating AML M4 or M5
             subtype or high eIF4E expression.

             pregnancy test within 14 days of starting protocol and must not be breastfeeding. Men
             and women of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective means of
             contraception throughout the study and for at least 30 days after completion of

             ULN (or &lt; 5 x ULN if liver involvement with leukemia); serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN.

          -  Provide written consent after the investigational nature, study design, risks and
             benefits of the study have been explained.

          -  Accessible for treatment and follow up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled central nervous system involvement by AML.

          -  Active cardiovascular disease as defined by New York Heart Association (NYHA) class

             planned protocol treatment or required follow-up.

          -  Received any previous therapy for AML within 28 days prior to the study entry. Hydrea
             is permitted for the treatment of leukocytosis but must be stopped within 7 days of

          -  Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Concurrent treatment with other anti-cancer therapy.

          -  Known infection with HIV.

          -  History of other malignancy. Subjects who have been disease-free for 2 year or
             subjects with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer or
             successfully treated in situ carcinoma are eligible.
