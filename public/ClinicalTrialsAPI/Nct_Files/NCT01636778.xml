  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of SB-497115-GR to raise platelet counts
      in thrombocytopenic patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (platelet count &lt;80,000
      /μL, suggestive of compensated cirrhosis) to a level desirable to initiate antiviral therapy
      and to assess the ability of SB-497115-GR to maintain platelet counts at a level sufficient
      to minimise dose reductions of pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy
      with the expectation that a lower rate of Peg-IFN dose reduction and omission will translate
      to a higher rate of sustained viral response.

          -  A subject who applies to one of the following:

        Female subject with non-childbearing potential [i.e., physiologically incapable of
        becoming pregnant, who: has had a hysterectomy, or had a bilateral oophorectomy
        (ovariectomy), or had a bilateral tubal ligation, or is post-menopausal for greater than
        one year].

        Female subject with childbearing potential, has a negative urine or serum pregnancy test
        at screening and within the 24-hour period prior to the first dose of SB-497115-GR, and
        completely abstains from intercourse or agree to use two of the following acceptable
        methods of contraception for 14 days before exposure to SB-497115-GR, throughout the
        clinical trial, and for 24 weeks after completion or premature discontinuation from the
        study.

        Intrauterine device or intrauterine system that meets the effectiveness criteria as stated
        in the product label.

        Male partner sterilization prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and this
        male is the sole partner for that subject.

        Double-barrier contraception (condom with spermicidal jelly, or diaphragm with
        spermicide).

        Male subject with childbearing potential partner completely abstains from intercourse or
        agree to use condom and diaphragm with spermicide.

          -  Subjects who were diagnosed as hepatitis C or compensated liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh
             class A) without hepatic encephalopathy, or ascites. If there is a clear cirrhosis,
             treatment should be given with care as there is a potential of progressing to liver
             failure.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are appropriate candidates for
             Peg-IFN and RBV combination therapy for 48 weeks.

          -  HCV positive by TaqMan test at screening.

          -  Subject who fulfil all the organ functions below.

        Prothrombin time &gt;60%

        *If the investigators consider the values are sufficient to give Peg-IFN/RBV, then a
        subject can be enrolled upon consulting the Medical Monitor.

             thrombocytopenia.

          -  Subject who received IFN therapy (including Peg-IFN), antiviral therapy (excluding
             oseltamivir phosphate, etc.), immuno-modulatory treatment, radiotherapy or phlebotomy
             within 3 months (90 days) prior to the first dose of SB-497115-GR.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days prior to the first dose of

             Grade III/IV), or arrhythmias known to involve the risk of thromboembolic events
             (e.g. atrial fibrillation), or subjects with a QTcF &gt;450 msec or if with bundle
             brunch block, QTcF &gt;480 msec.

          -  Subject with depression, psychiatric disorder requiring treatment or suicidal
             ideation or suicide attempt history, or history of these.
