    <description>Only 5 patients had partial pharmacokinetic (PK) data available. Plasma concentration of oseltamivir was measured at several time points in one patient receiving neuraminidase inhibitor monotherapy. Plasma concentration of oseltamivir, amantadine, and ribavirin were measured at several time points in four patients receiving TCAD therapy. Area under the time-concentration curve up to the last measured time point (AUC0-last) was calculated from the plasma concentration-time profiles by non-compartmental analysis.</description>

          4. Current clinical evidence of a recognized or suspected uncontrolled non-influenza
             infectious illness with onset prior to screening

          5. Known hypersensitivity to amantadine, ribavirin, oseltamivir or zanamivir

          7. Psychiatric or cognitive illness, or recreational drug/alcohol use that, in the
             opinion of the principal investigator, would affect patient safety and/or compliance

          8. Uncontrolled seizure disorder or history of a seizure activity within 12 months prior
