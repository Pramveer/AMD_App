  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safe and effective dose range of
      boceprevir (SCH 503034) in combination with PEG-Intron in adult subjects who have chronic
      hepatitis C without cirrhosis, and who have failed an adequate course of combination therapy
      with peginterferon-alfa plus ribavirin. A secondary objective is to explore whether
      ribavirin provides an additional benefit when combined with PEG-Intron plus boceprevir.

    <description>Sustained Viral Response (SVR) was defined as the percentage of participants with HCV-RNA undetectable at the follow-up Week 24.
All percentages were based on the total number of participants originally randomized/enrolled to that particular arm.
For Arm 1B, the denominator for the percentages was the number who received at least 1 dose of BOC.
Arm 1A was not analyzed.</description>

    <description>For each log drop category (&lt;0, 0 to 0.5, 0.5 to &lt;1, 1 to &lt;1.5, ≥1.5, and Missing), the percentage of participants receiving combination therapy who were HCV-RNA negative at EoT (Week 49) was calculated as follows:
Number of participants in a log category who were HCV-RNA negative divided by the total number of participants in that log drop category (n).
Percentages were NOT derived using treatment arm N values. The sum of the n values for all 6 log drop categories within a treatment arm equals the overall N for that treatment group.</description>
