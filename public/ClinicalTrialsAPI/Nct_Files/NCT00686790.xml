  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5
      mcg/kg/week administered for 52 weeks (wk) in previously untreated participants coinfected
      with hepatitis virus B and D. After 52-week treatment and 52-week follow-up, the virologic,
      biochemical, and histological response will be evaluated.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>For virological response, a participant was defined as a responder if his/her serum sample tested negative for Hepatitis D Virus - ribonucleic acid (HDV-RNA) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at end of treatment (EOT).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With a Biochemical Response</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks (EOT), 104 weeks (EOF)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>A participant was defined as a responder if his alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level after 52 weeks, i.e. at EOT, was below the upper reference range as specified by Bioclinica. The normal reference range for ALT is 5-55 U/L.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With a Combined Response</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks (EOT), 104 weeks (EOF)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The combined response was defined as an ALT level below the upper
reference range and a negative HDV-RNA test. The normal reference range for ALT is 5-55 U/L.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Replication Response (HBV Response)</measure>
    <time_frame>52 week (EOT)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Serum samples collected from the participants were tested by PCR to detect HBV-DNA. HBV response was defined as the absence of HBV-deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV-DNA) in serum.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With a Liver Histology Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 52 week (EOT)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The liver histology response was defined as at least a 2 point decrease in the necrosis inflammation score (a sum of periportal necrosis [0-10], lobular inflammation [0-4], portal inflammation [0-4], with the total score of 18 representing the worst outcome) and no increase or regression of fibrosis (scored [0-4]) in the pre- and post-treatment liver biopsies.
The efficacy of treatment based on histological response was assessed by the investigator as complete response, partial response, minimal response, progressive disease, and not assessable at EOT.</description>
