  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of eltrombopag to maintain a platelet
      count sufficient to facilitate initiation of antiviral therapy, to minimise antiviral
      therapy dose reductions and to avoid permanent discontinuation of antiviral therapy. The
      clinical benefit of eltrombopag will be measured by the proportion of subjects who are able
      to achieve a Sustained Virological Response (SVR).

    <description>Participants were assessed for a shift from a baseline platelet count of &lt;75 Gi/L to a count &gt;=90 Gi/L during the OL Phase (up to 9 weeks). Local laboratories were used for platelet function tests. Platelet counts were measured by blood draw.</description>

    <description>In the OL Phase, participants initially received the lowest dose of eltrombopag (25 mg QD) for 2 weeks. If after this time the platelet count was &lt;90 Gi/L, participants underwent sequential dose escalation to the next highest dose (50 mg QD for up to 2 weeks), with further dose escalations to 75 mg QD (up to 2 weeks) and 100 mg QD (up to a maximum of 3 weeks) if platelet counts remained &lt;90 Gi/L.

    <description>Participants were assigned a score equal to the number of times their dose of antiviral therapy (peginterferon or ribavirin) was reduced (0=no dose reductions [DRs]; 1=one DR; 2=two DRs; 3=three DRs; &gt;3=more than three DRs). Where possible, every effort was made to maintain the recommended dose of antiviral therapy for the treatment duration in the DB Phase. However, where dose modification of antiviral therapy was required due to safety concerns, it was performed by the Investigator as per the region-specific product labels of peginterferon and ribavirin.</description>

    <description>The assigned dose in the DB Phase of peginterferon alfa-2a was 180 micrograms (mcg). For peginterferon dose modification, downward adjustments in one level increments was considered. The lowest dose of peginterferon alfa-2a that was allowed to be administered was 45 mcg. Where dose adjustment was required for moderate to severe adverse reactions (clinical and/or laboratory), an initial dose reduction to 135 mcg was generally adequate. In some cases, a dose reduction to 90 mcg or 45mcg was necessary. Dose increases toward the original dose were considered when the adverse reaction was resolved.</description>

    <description>There are two genetic variants (rs12979860 and rs8099917) mapping near IL28B associated with both interferon-induced SVR and spontaneous HCV clearance. Genotyping of the IL28B polymorphisms (rs12979860 and rs8099917) was conducted. IL28B genotype distribution by response to antiviral therapy (SVR and RVR) for both treatment arms was assessed. The effect of genotype was tested by comparing participants that carried 2 copies of the IL28B favorable response allele versus the others (recessive model). Genotypes at rs12979860 were coded as: CC=1, CT or TT=0; rs8099917 was coded as TT=1, GT or GG=0.</description>

    <description>Ophthalmic (pertaining to eye) assessments were performed during the study. A cataract event is defined as an event ascertained to be a cataract (opacity or cloudiness of the lens of the eye, causing impairment of vision) by at least one of the CEC members (comprised of expert ophthalmologists who provided objective medical review of the blinded ophthalmic data). Per the CEC, cataract events were categorized as: (1) Cataract Progression (CP; progression of cataracts present at BL); and (2) Incident Cataract (IC; development of new cataracts).
