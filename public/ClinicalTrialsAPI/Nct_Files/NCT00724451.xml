    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to elucidate the reasons why patients with chronic hepatitis C
      (CHC) would not be considered eligible for antiviral treatment. The study is conducted in
      common clinical practice at approximately 54 sites in Italy. Patients deemed eligible for
      antiviral therapy will be treated at the discretion of the physician with either
      peginterferon alfa-2a or peginterferon alfa-2b, both in combination with ribavirin, in
      accordance with approved labeling. A secondary objective of this study is to define
      &quot;treatment failure&quot; and to evaluate the reasons for treatment discontinuation.

      Probability sampling: Consecutive adult patients with chronic hepatitis C in clinical
      practice at approximately 54 sites in Italy will be included in the study. The decision as
      to treatment choice falls at the discretion of the treating physician.
