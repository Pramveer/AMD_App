  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In February 2002, a French Consensus Conference on the management of patients with chronic
      hepatitis C in France was organized. The jury issued several recommendations on pegylated
      alpha interferon/ribavirin treatment strategy. Three years after these recommendations, it
      is of interest to understand the evolution of hepatitis C management in France in real
      clinical practice. This observational study will permit the identification of patients who
      are treated and will provide information on the use of PegIntron/ Ribavirin.

      To assure a good representation of participants treated for hepatitis C, participants who
      meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled on a consecutive basis.
