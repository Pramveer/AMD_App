    <textblock>
      Surveillance will be conducted at digestive departments of internal medicine in university
      or general hospitals where participants with chronic hepatitis C are generally treated. The
      purpose of this surveillance is to evaluate the postmarketing safety and efficacy of
      PegIntron Injection under actual conditions of use and to examine adverse events, serious
      adverse events, and adverse drug reactions.

    <description>Serious adverse events (SAE's) were events that resulted in death, were life threatening, required hospitalization, caused disability, and congenital anomaly. All SAE's related or unrelated to the study drug and those SAE's that were determined by the investigator, using specific criteria defined in the protocol, were reported.</description>
