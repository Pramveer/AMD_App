    <textblock>
      In this study Peg-Intron will be tested to see if it will give better results than
      Colchicine. At this time, there is currently no recommended maintenance treatment for
      patients who have failed to respond to Interferon/Rebetron/Peg Intron and have advanced
      fibrosis. The purpose of this study is to compare two treatments to slow down the
      progression of liver disease and to prevent liver failure and liver cancer. The treatment
      will not cure Hepatitis C, but is being evaluated to see if it can slow down disease
      progression.

      We are proposing a randomized trial of Peg-Intron 0.5mcg per kg weekly versus colchicine
      0.6mg bid in prior non-responders to Interferon, Rebetron, PegIntron, or PegIntron &amp;
      Ribavirin or any third agent such as Pegasys, CellCept, Amantadine with advanced
      fibrosis/cirrhosis. The specific aims of this proposal are to evaluate the role of long term
      Peg-Intron therapy on the natural history of patients with advanced chronic HCV infection
      with a primary focus on prevention of hepatic decompensation, progression of fibrosis and
      hepatoma development.

      The study design will focus on 3 monthly clinical evaluation for decompensation of liver
      function, rigorous clinical screening for development of hepatocellular cancer and liver
      biopsies for determination of progression of liver fibrosis every second year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  *Adult male or female, age 18 to 75 years

               -  HCV RNA positive by PCR

               -  Previous treatment with at least three months of interferon or interferon /
                  Ribavirin. Patients should have had no interferon for at least 2 months prior to
                  enrollment.

                    1. Non-responders are identified by failure to clear virus by PCR after a
                       minimum 3-month course of treatment and who have been off treatment for at
                       least 2 months with a positive PCR for HCV prior to entry into the current
                       study, 2) Partial responders have a reduction of 1 long in HCV RNA, but the
                       virus is still detectable, 3) Breakthrough patients have been negative on
                       treatment, but virus appeared while still on treatment, 4) Relapsers are
                       defined as negative PCR at some point during treatment, but virus
                       reoccurred or was detectable by HCV PCR when treatment stopped.

        Patients should have had a liver biopsy showing at least Stage 3 disease prior to being
        considered for this study. A baseline liver biopsy is necessary for inclusion in the
        study. Baseline liver biopsies can be performed within six months of entering the study.

        In patients with cirrhosis and endoscopic evidence of portal hypertension, a biopsy within
        the last 2 years is acceptable as the baseline biopsy. For patients with established
        cirrhosis on liver biopsy and no portal hypertension, a biopsy within 12 months can be
        used as the baseline biopsy if it is available for evaluation by the Pathology core. All
        these patients will still require liver biopsy at 2 years and 4 years. The decision to
        biopsy at 2 and 4 years is also a clinical decision and in the presence of clinical
        progression or coagulopathy, or where there may be a risk from liver biopsy, the
        Investigator should call the PI, Dr. Afdhal for a waiver of biopsy. Patients with Ishak
        Stage 3 and 4 require a biopsy within 6 months of randomization.

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 11 g/dl in males and 10 g/dl in females

          -  Neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mm3

        Platelet count: For standard dose of PEG-Intron 0.5mcg/kg platelet count must be greater
        than 70,000. Patients with platelet count 50 - 70,000 can start at 0.25mcg/kg for weeks 0
        - 4. If platelets fall to less than 30,000, stop treatment. If platelets remain &gt; 50,000
        at week 4, PEG-Intron can be increased to 0.5mcg/kg. Patients randomized to Colchicine
        with platelets 50,000 - 70,000 can be started at standard dose 0.6mg bid po with standard
        dose reduction.

                  any patient with an Alpha-fetoprotein &gt;100 ng/ml either a triple phase contrast
                  CT scan or MRI with gadolinium must show no focal mass or evidence of HCC

               -  Ultrasound with no evidence of focal mass suggestive of hepatoma (within 6
                  months of informed consent).

          -  Pre-existing psychiatric condition, especially severe depression, or a history of
             severe psychiatric disorder
