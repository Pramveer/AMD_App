    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      antiviral activity of ABT-333 (also known as dasabuvir) in treatment-naïve, hepatitis C
      virus (HCV)-infected participants.

    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 2a, blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in hepatitis C
      virus (HCV)-infected adults with 2 planned sequential evaluations, Part 1 and Part 2. The
      study evaluated the safety, tolerability, antiviral activity, and pharmacokinetics of
      ABT-333 or placebo monotherapy, followed by 26 days of ABT-333 or placebo with pegylated
      interferon a-2a (pegIFN) and ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy. Review of safety and
      efficacy in Part 1 of the study showed similar response rates across ABT-333 doses so Part 2
      of the study was not performed. The study also assessed emergence of resistant HCV in
      conjunction with kinetics of viral load decay and rebound in treatment-naïve, HCV-infected
      participants.

    <description>Serum hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) levels (reported as log10 IU/mL) were determined for each sample using a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The baseline value was the HCV RNA measurement before the first dose of ABT-333 on Day 1. The maximal change during monotherapy was nadir minus the baseline log10 HCV RNA level. Nadir was defined as the lowest log10 HCV RNA level any time after the first dose of study drug on Day 1 through the last log10 HCV RNA level before the first dose of study drug on Day 3. Data are reported as the least squares mean change from nadir ± standard error.</description>

    <description>Blood samples were collected pre-dose (time 0 hours); 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 hours after the morning dose on Day 1; and pre-dose on Day 2. The samples were analyzed for the concentration of ABT-333 using validated analytical methods. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax; measured in ng/mL) is the highest concentration that a drug achieves in the blood after administration in a dosing interval. The Cmax of ABT-333 was estimated using non-compartmental methods and data are reported as the mean ± standard deviation.</description>

    <description>Blood samples were collected pre-dose (time 0 hours); 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 hours after the morning dose on Day 1; and pre-dose on Day 2. The samples were analyzed for the concentration of ABT-333 using validated analytical methods. The time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax; measured in hours) is the time it takes for a drug to achieve Cmax.

    <time_frame>AEs were collected from the time of study drug administration to 30 days after last dose of study drug (8 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence that did not have a causal relationship with treatment. An Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) was any noxious and undesired reaction related to the experimental drug or experiment. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in death, was life-threatening, resulted in or prolonged hospitalization, resulted in congenital anomaly, was persistent or caused significant disability/incapacity, spontaneous or elective abortion, or required intervention to prevent a serious outcome. AEs were rated for severity as either:
Mild - transient and easily tolerated;
Moderate - caused discomfort and interrupted usual activities;
Severe - caused considerable interference with usual activities, may be incapacitating or life-threatening.
AEs related to direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) were assessed as being either probably or possibly related by the investigator.</description>
