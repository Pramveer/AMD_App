      This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of treatment with sofosbuvir
      (SOF)/velpatasvir (VEL; GS-5816) fixed dose combination (FDC) for 12 weeks in participants
      with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

Non-response (HCV RNA persistently ≥ LLOQ through 8 weeks of treatment), or
Relapse (HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ during the post-treatment period having achieved HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at end of treatment, confirmed with 2 consecutive values or last available post-treatment measurement)</description>
