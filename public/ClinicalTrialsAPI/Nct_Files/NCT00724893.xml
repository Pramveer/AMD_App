  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment compliance is a key success factor in obtaining the full benefit of Pegetron
      (peginterferon alfa-2b [PegIFN-2b] plus ribavirin combination) therapy for patients.
      Treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in Canada to whom Pegetron Redipen
      was prescribed will receive Pegetron Redipen therapy in accordance with approved labeling.
      The study will assess the effect of the newly approved Pegetron Redipen on treatment
      compliance and its effect on sustained virologic response rates. Sustained virologic
      response is defined as negative hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV-RNA) six months
      post-treatment.

For this analysis participants were grouped by their HCV genotype subcategory (1a or 1b); subcategories are the result of a change in the genetic material in the viruses within the genotype.</description>

    <description>Compliance was defined as participants taking ≥80% versus &lt;80% of their doses; compliance ≥80% was derived from participants who answered &quot;always&quot; or &quot;most of the time&quot; to Questions 4 (How often do you stick to your medication schedule for your Ribavirin?) and 5 (How often do you stick to your medication schedule for your Redipen [peginterferon] injections?) of the 6-question compliance questionnaire. Percentages are based on the total number of participants within each compliance category. SVR was defined as HCV-RNA negative at 24 weeks after EOT. Participants with no viral response information were considered viral response &quot;no&quot;.</description>
