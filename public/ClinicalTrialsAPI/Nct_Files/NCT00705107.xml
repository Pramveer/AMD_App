    <textblock>
      Adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen with PegIntron and Rebetol affects the chance
      of achieving a sustained virologic response in patients with hepatitis C. The objective of
      this study is to evaluate the proportion of patients who complete treatment with PegIntron
      pen and Rebetol while participating in a patient assistance program. The patient assistance
      program can consist of prophylactic treatment (eg, with growth factors, psychiatric
      medications) or other interventions (eg, psychotherapy, patient support groups, visiting
      nurse, nurse telephone calls, educational literature).

        Treatment-naïve adult patients with hepatitis C treated with PegIntron pen and Rebetol
        receiving a patient assistance program at approximately 40 sites in Romania. Patient
        assistance program can consist of prophylactic treatment (eg, with growth factors,
        psychiatric medications) or other interventions (eg, psychotherapy, patient support
        groups, visiting nurse, nurse telephone calls, educational literature).
