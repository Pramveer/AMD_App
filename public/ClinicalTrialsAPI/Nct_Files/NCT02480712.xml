    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the antiviral efficacy, safety and tolerability of sofosbuvir
      (SOF)/velpatasvir (VEL; GS-5816) fixed dose combination (FDC) administered for 12 weeks in
      HCV treatment-naive and treatment-experienced (including treatment intolerant) adults with
      chronic HCV infection who are coinfected with HIV-1.
