      After fulfillment of the selection criteria, all the patients included in the trial will be
      administered Tenofovir that will be continued for 3 months and then stopped for 1 month,
      LFT's, HBV DNA, HBsAg, will be checked weekly during the time period of stopping Tenofovir
      and thereafter at 4 months patients with ALT &gt;/= 1.5 times ULN will be randomised in 2
      groups to administer either Peg INF alpha 2b + Tenofovir (in same dose as before) or
      Tenofovir alone which will be continued for 48 weeks and the patients with no rise in ALT
      will be excluded. Patients will be closely monitored during the period of stopping tenofovir
      post pulse therapy and liver function tests will be performed weekly. Patients will be
      closely observed for the development of acute hepatitis or decompensation during the 4 -
      week period of drug withdrawal. Thereafter, CBC, KFT, LFT's, PT-INR, HBsAg (Q), HBeAg and
      HBV DNA levels will be tested every 3 months. After stopping treatment followup will be done
      at 24 weeks post stoppage of treatment to look for sustained seroconversion and
      virological/biochemical response
