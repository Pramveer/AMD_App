  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study comparing grazoprevir (MK-5172) + elbasvir (MK-8742) treatment with
      sofosbuvir (SOF) + Pegylated Interferon + Ribavirin [PR] treatment in treatment-naïve and
      prior PR treatment failure participants with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) genotype (GT)1, GT4,
      or GT6 infection. The primary objectives are to compare efficacy (assessed by the percentage
      of participants achieving sustained virologic response 12 weeks after ending study treatment
      [SVR12]) and safety between grazoprevir + elbasvir and SOF + PR treatment arms. The primary
      hypothesis is that the percentage of participants achieving SVR12 in the grazoprevir +
      elbasvir arm is non-inferior to that in the SOF + PR arm.
