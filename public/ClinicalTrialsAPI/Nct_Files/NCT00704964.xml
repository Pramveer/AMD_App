  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the impact of participant care and support on
      treatment adherence. PegIntron pen and Rebetol will be administered to participants with
      Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) in accordance with approved labeling. Sites will be categorized as
      providing high vs low level of participant management based on information about the level
      of participant support and management captured on the site questionnaire. Data on each
      participant will be collected by a physician on an electronic participant case report form
      (CRF) and by the participant via a questionnaire. Treatment completion rates will be
      analyzed based on the high vs low level of participant management.

      The hypothesis is that Physicians investing more time and effort into participant management
      achieve higher treatment completion rates among their hepatitis C patients than physicians
      offering less participant management measures.
