      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-depressive efficacy of mirtazapine in
      depression induced by peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin treatment in Korean patients with
      chronic hepatitis C.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a common serious adverse event (30%-50%) during the interferon treatment for
      chronic hepatitis C. Adequate control of depressive symptoms might enable to adhere to
      antiviral therapy and lead to the favorable prognosis for patients with chronic hepatitis C.

      Mirtazapine is an effective antidepressant for depressive mood as well as insomnia and
      anxiety. Mirtazapine has also relatively lower drug-drug interactions, which are important
      for patients with hepatic dysfunction.

      In this study, the investigators are going to perform an 8-week, randomized, open label
      trial comparing anti-depressive efficacy between mirtazapine and supportive psychotherapy in
      depression induced by peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin treatment in Korean patients with
      chronic hepatitis C.
