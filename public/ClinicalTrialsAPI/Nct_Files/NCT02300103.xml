      This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of treatment with sofosbuvir
      (SOF)/velpatasvir (VEL; GS-5816) with ribavirin (RBV) for 24 weeks in adults with chronic
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who participated in a prior Gilead sponsored study and did
      not achieve sustained virologic response (SVR).
