  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag when used to
      increase and maintain platelet count. Platelet count to be maintained at a level sufficient
      to facilitate initiation of antiviral therapy, to minimize antiviral therapy dose
      reductions, and to avoid permanent discontinuation of antiviral therapy.

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, may jeopardize the participant or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury. Refer to the general AE/SAE module for a list of AEs and SAEs.</description>

    <description>LogMAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) charts are used to measure an individual's visual acuity. LogMAR, expressed as the (decadic) logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (range from +1.00 to -0.30), converts the geometric sequence of a traditional chart to a linear scale. As there are 5 letters per line, the total score for a line on the LogMAR chart represents a change of 0.1 log units.</description>

    <description>SVR is defined as non-detectable Hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) at 24 weeks post-completion of the planned treatment period (i.e., Week 48 or 72 for genotype 2/3 or Week 72 for non-genotype 2/3). RVR is defined as undetectable HCV RNA after 4 weeks of antiviral treatment. EVR is defined as clinically significant reduction in HCV RNA (&gt;=2 log10 drop or undetectable) after 12 weeks of antiviral treatment. ETR is defined as undetectable HCV RNA at the end of antiviral treatment.</description>
