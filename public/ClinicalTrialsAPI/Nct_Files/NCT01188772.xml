  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genotype 1: Participants with genotype 1 hepatitis C (HCV) infection were randomized to
      receive sofosbuvir (GS-7977; PSI-7977) 200 mg or 400 mg, or matching placebo, plus pegylated
      interferon alfa 2a (PEG) and ribavirin (RBV) for 12 weeks, followed by PEG+RBV for an up to
      an additional 36 weeks. Randomization was stratified by IL28B status (CC, CT, TT) and HCV
      RNA level (&lt; 800,000 IU/ml or ≥ 800,000 IU/ml) at baseline. Participants were randomized in
      a 2:2:1 manner; those who achieved an extended rapid virologic response (eRVR) (HCV RNA &lt;
      lower limit of detection [15 IU/mL] from Weeks 4 through 12) received an additional 12 weeks
      of PEG+RBV. Subjects not achieving eRVR received an additional 36 weeks of PEG+RBV.

      Genotype 2 and 3: Participants with genotype 2 or 3 hepatitis C (HCV) received sofosbuvir
      400 mg plus PEG+RBV for 12 weeks.
