  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection with both HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) may result in serious and sometimes
      fatal liver disease. The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of long-term
      pegylated interferon alfa-2a (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin treatment in slowing liver disease
      progression in people infected with both HIV and HCV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rapid progression of liver disease to liver failure has been observed in people coinfected
      with HIV and HCV. This observation appears to be directly related to an increase in the rate
      of fibrotic progression in the liver compared to people infected with HCV alone. PEG-IFN and
      ribavirin are used in standard treatment of HCV. This study will test the effectiveness of
      using PEG-IFN and ribavirin in reducing the rate of liver fibrosis progression in patients
      coinfected with HIV and HCV who cannot lower their HCV viral load to undetectable or who
      cannot maintain their HCV viral load at undetectable.

      Patients will enter Step 1 (also known as Arm A) and will receive 180 mcg PEG-IFN
      subcutaneously once weekly for at least 12 weeks and up to 18 weeks. They will also receive
      1 to 1.2 g/day ribavirin based on weight. Participants may continue to receive Step 1
      treatment to determine if they meet the early viral response criteria based on an evaluation
      at the Week 12 visit. If a participant has less than a 2-log drop in HCV viral load and
      detectable HCV viral load in their blood, participants must discontinue study treatment.
      Those who tolerated Step 1 therapy and have a 2-log or more drop in HCV viral load or have
      undetectable HCV viral load will enter Step 3. Step 2 is closed as of 05/10/07. If a
      participant does not meet the criteria for entry into Step 3, the participant must
      discontinue study treatment and follow procedures for the Step 1 discontinuation. Step 3
      patients will continue their Step 1 treatment for an additional 60 weeks and will be
      followed for 24 weeks after stopping treatment. Due to the closure of Step 2, Step 3
      patients who have a detectable HCV viral load at Week 36 will now stay on Step 3 until the
      end of the study.

      Liver biopsies will be conducted at study entry and at the end of Step 3. Medical history
      assessment, physical exams, and blood collection will be conducted every 4 weeks for
      patients in Steps 1, 2, and 3. Patients will be followed for 72 to 102 weeks, depending on
      their treatment arm assignment.
