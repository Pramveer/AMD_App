    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate in subjects receiving their first course of
      peg-interferon α-2b plus ribavirin therapy for chronic HCV infection (genotype 1) whether
      the addition of infliximab to a standard regimen of pegylated interferon α-2b in combination
      with ribavirin:

        -  increases the proportion of subjects attaining a sustained virological response SVR
           (undetectable blood Hepatitis C viral load 6 months after treatment)

        -  improves the safety profile compared to the same regimen without infliximab
