  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) and weight-based dose of boceprevir
      following single oral dose administration in Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) pediatric
      participants.

  <why_stopped>
    The US FDA and the EU CHMP provided guidance indicating preference for intereferon-free
    regimens in pediatric studies of HCV infection.
