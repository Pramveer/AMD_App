      The objective of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of PegIntron injector and
      Rebetol administered to participants with chronic hepatitis C. Participants will be treated
      by general practitioners in clinical practice as part of the post-marketing surveillance
      study. The study will assess the rates of eradication of the hepatits C virus and the rates
      of serious adverse events reported with PegIntron (1.5 μg/kg/week) and Rebetol (800-1200
      mg/day) in common medical practice in Germany.
