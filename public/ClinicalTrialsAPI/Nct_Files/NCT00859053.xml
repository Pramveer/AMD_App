    <time_frame>Pre-dose (0), 0.5,1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72 hours post-dose (both healthy and hepatically impaired participants) and 96 hours post-dose (only for hepatically impaired participants)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Apparent total body clearance was calculated as dose/AUC(INF). AUC(INF) was estimated as AUC(0-T) + Ct/λ z, where λ z was the terminal elimination rate constant and Ct was the last observable concentration.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Clearance of Free BMS-790052 (CLu/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose (0), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72 hours post-dose (both healthy and hepatically impaired participants) and 96 hours post-dose (only for hepatically impaired participants)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>CLu/F was calculated by dividing the apparent total body clearance (CLT/F) by mean fraction of unbound drug (fu) for both (1 hour and 4 hour post dose) time points combined. Apparent total body clearance was calculated as dose/AUC(INF). AUC(INF) was estimated as AUC(0-T) + Ct/ λz, where λz was the terminal elimination rate constant and Ct was the last observable concentration.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Apparent Volume of Distribution at Steady State (Vss/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose (0), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72 hours post-dose (both healthy and hepatically impaired participants) and 96 hours post-dose (only for hepatically impaired participants)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Apparent volume of distribution was calculated by dividing the product of the dose and mean residence time (MRT) by AUC(INF). AUC(INF) was estimated as AUC(0-T) + Ct/λ z, where λ z was the terminal elimination rate constant and Ct was the last observable concentration.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Discontinuations Due to Adverse Events (AEs), and Who Died</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to end of study for AEs and, Day 1 to up to 30 days after last dose for SAE.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>AE was defined as any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a pre-existing condition that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. SAE was defined as a medical event that at any dose resulted in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency/abuse; was life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or required or prolonged hospitalization. Study Discharge (end of study) was Day 4 (healthy participants) or Day 5 (hepatically impaired participants).</description>
