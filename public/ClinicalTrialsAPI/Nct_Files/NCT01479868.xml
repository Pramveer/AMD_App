      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TMC435 along with
      pegylated interferon alpha-2a (PegIFNα-2a) and ribavirin (RBV) triple therapy in hepatitis C
      virus genotype-1 infected subjects, co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus-type 1,
      and to evaluate the number of patients with sustained virologic response (SVR) at 12 weeks
      after the planned end of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all the people know the identity of the intervention), single arm
      (study will be conducted in a single group) clinical study, to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and efficacy of TMC435 along with pegylated interferon alpha-2a (PegIFNα-2a)
      and ribavirin (RBV) triple therapy in adult chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype-1 infected
      patients who are co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1). The study
      consists of 3 phases, screening phase (Week -6), treatment phase, and a follow-up phase (up
      to 24 weeks). In the treatment phase, patients will be classified based on their experience
      with previous hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment as follows: 1) HCV treatment-naive (patients
      who never received medication for the treatment of HCV); 2) prior HCV relapsers (patients
      who received at least 24 weeks of a PegIFNα-2a and RBV-based therapy and relapsed within 1
      year after the last medication intake); and 3) prior HCV non-responders (can be further
      classified as, null responders: patients having at least 1 prior documented course of
      PegIFNα-2a and RBV therapy for at least 12 consecutive weeks; or partial responders:
      patients having at least 20 consecutive weeks which has not been discontinued due to
      intolerability to PegIFNα-2a and RBV therapy). All patients will receive TMC435 once daily
      along with PegIFNα-2a and RBV for 12 weeks. Patients who are continuing treatment only with
      PegIFNα-2a and RBV will follow until 24 or 48 weeks. Pharmacokinetics will be measured after
      collection of blood samples. Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical laboratory
      tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, physical examinations, and specific toxicities will
      be performed throughout the study. The total duration of treatment is approximately of 24
      weeks.
