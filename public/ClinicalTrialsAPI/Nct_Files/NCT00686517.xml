  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of three regimens of pegylated
      interferon-alfa 2b (PEG-IFN) either as monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin in
      participants with acute hepatitis C. After 12 weeks of observation from disease onset,
      participants will receive one of the following regimens: (1) a 24-week course of PEG-IFN
      monotherapy (PEG-IFN 24); or (2) a 12-week course of PEG-IFN monotherapy (PEG-IFN-12); or
      (3) a 12-week course of PEG-IFN in combination with ribavirin (PEG-IFN + RVB 12). After the
      treatment period, participants will enter a 12-month follow-up.

    <description>ALT normalization was used as a measure of biochemical response to treatment. ALT levels were assessed at each study visit by the local laboratory, and efficacy measurements at the end of treatment, at 6 and 12 months post treatment follow-up were reported.</description>
