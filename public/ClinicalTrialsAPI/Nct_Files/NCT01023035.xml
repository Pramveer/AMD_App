    <textblock>
      The current trial is designed to prospectively explore the safety of erythropoietin use for
      the treatment of anemia during boceprevir plus peginterferon alfa-2b/Ribavirin (PEG2b/RBV)
      therapy and to assess its relationship to efficacy. All participants in this trial will be
      treated with the triple combination of boceprevir plus PEG2b/RBV. If a participant becomes
      anemic during treatment, the participant will be randomized to one of two therapeutic
      strategies for management of anemia (erythropoietin use versus RBV dose reduction).
