  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who are recently infected with HCV have a great chance of being cured of the
      infection when they are treated with a combination of two drugs within the first 6 months of
      being infected. This study is being done to see if a combination of two new drugs in one
      pill can replace the old drugs to provide a safer, more effective, and better tolerated
      treatment for new HCV infection. The names of the new drugs are ledipasvir (LDV) and
      sofosbuvir (SOF), and they will replace pegylated-interferon alfa (PEG-IFN, a drug given as
      a weekly injection under the skin). The fixed-dose combination of LDV and SOF (LDV/SOF) has
      been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

      This study started with participants in Group 1 receiving SOF in combination with RBV, a
      drug also approved by the FDA, for 12 weeks. There were a total of 17 participants in Group
      1 and all completed treatment. All participants were monitored for safety and viral response
      while on treatment. After completing treatment, all participants were evaluated for a
      treatment response after the end of treatment.

      If the treatment response in Group 1 was high enough, the study design allowed for the
      possibility to decrease the length of therapy for Group 2 to 8 weeks, using the same
      treatment. However, this did not occur. Combined with the fact that a new and more effective
      treatment for chronic HCV has been approved since the study started, Group 2 will now
      receive 8 weeks of LDV/SOF instead of 12 or 8 weeks of SOF with RBV.

        A5327 Eligibility Criteria (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2)

        Step 1 inclusion criteria for both cohorts (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2)

          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 p24 antigen, or plasma HIV-1 RNA
             viral load. [NOTE: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a FDA-approved kit, which is
             required for all IND studies.] WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for
             Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial
             test result must use a test that is different from the one used for the initial
             assessment. A reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type
             of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or
             different test principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a
             plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

          -  A documented confirmation of acute HCV infection within 6 months prior to A5327 entry
             or HCV reinfection as described below:

               1. Acute HCV infection will be defined as meeting one of the following criteria and
                  exclusion of other causes of acute hepatitis:

                    -  New (&lt;24 weeks prior to initial A5327 entry) ALT elevation to ≥5X upper
                       limit of normal (ULN) OR &gt;250 U/L in patients with documented normal ALT in
                       the preceding 12 months or ≥10X ULN OR &gt;500 U/L in patients with abnormal
                       or no measured ALT baseline in the preceding 12 months with detectable HCV
                       RNA excluding those with any prior positive anti-HCV. OR

                    -  Detectable HCV RNA with prior negative anti-HCV Ab or undetectable HCV RNA
                       within the preceding 6 months.

               2. Acute HCV reinfection will be defined by documentation of clearance of prior
                  infection (as evidenced by positive anti-HCV Ab) either spontaneously or after
                  treatment with two negative HCV RNA a minimum of 6 months apart AND meeting one
                  of the following criteria in addition to exclusion of other causes of acute
                  hepatitis:

                    -  New (&lt;24 weeks prior to initial A5327 entry) ALT elevation to ≥5X ULN OR
                       &gt;250 U/L in patients with documented normal ALT in the preceding 12 months
                       or ≥10X ULN OR &gt;500 U/L in patients with abnormal or no measured ALT
                       baseline in the preceding 12 months with detectable HCV RNA. OR

                    -  Positive HCV RNA with prior negative HCV RNA within the preceding 6 months.

          -  HCV RNA confirmed to be detectable &gt;12 weeks after first laboratory evidence of acute
             HCV and still within the &lt;24 week from first laboratory evidence of acute HCV
             infection window. First laboratory evidence of infection is defined as date of first
             elevated liver enzymes or date of first serologic evidence of HCV seroconversion
             and/or viremia (whichever occurs first). [NOTE: If the screening visit occurs less
             than 12 weeks from the first laboratory evidence of infection, then the participant
             will require a pre-entry study visit to confirm detectable HCV RNA at least 12 weeks
             from the first laboratory evidence of infection have passed. It is optimal for this
             pre-entry visit to occur as close as possible to 12 weeks from first laboratory
             evidence to ensure timely treatment. Potential participants who enter screening but
             who have an undetectable HCV RNA (&lt;LLOQ TND) at the pre-entry visit (when required)
             will have exhibited evidence of possible spontaneous clearance and will not meet the
             entry criteria.]

          -  Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 kg/m2

          -  Screening electrocardiogram (ECG) without clinically significant abnormalities as
             determined by the investigator.

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Men and women age ≥ 18 years.

          -  All participants must agree not to participate in a conception process (eg, active
             attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization).
             [NOTE: Female candidates who are pregnant or breastfeeding are not eligible. A male
             candidate who has a pregnant female partner is not eligible for the study.]

          -  When participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, all participants
             must agree to use at least two reliable forms of contraceptive simultaneously while
             receiving protocol-specified medications, and for 6 months after stopping the
             medications. Such methods include:

               -  Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent

               -  Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide

               -  Intrauterine device (IUD)

               -  Tubal ligation

               -  Hormone-based contraceptive (except those containing drospirenone)

        [NOTE: Providers and participants should be advised that not all contraceptive choices
        listed above can prevent HIV transmission and that some may actually increase the risk of
        HIV acquisition. Study participants who are sexually active with HIV-1 negative or unknown
        HIV-1 serostatus partners should be advised that they need to consider effective
        strategies for reducing the risk of HIV transmission, as well as meeting the requirement
        for effective contraception during their participation in the study. Study participants
        should discuss contraceptive choices and HIV risk reduction methods with their health care
        provider.]

          -  Participants who are not of reproductive potential (women who have been
             post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months or have undergone hysterectomy
             and/or bilateral oophorectomy or salpingectomy or men who have documented azoospermia
             or undergone vasectomy) are eligible without requiring the use of contraceptives.
             Acceptable documentation of sterilization and menopause is specified below.

               -  Written or oral documentation communicated by clinician or clinician's staff of
                  one of the following:

               -  Physician report/letter

               -  Operative report or other source documentation in the patient record (a

                  measured by any local laboratory using an FDA-approved assay.

          -  Candidates must have the following laboratory parameters within 10-42 days prior to
             study entry:

               1. Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL for male and female participants

               2. International normalized ratio (INR) ≤1.5 x ULN unless participant has known
                  hemophilia or is stable on an anticoagulant regimen affecting INR

               3. Albumin ≥3 g/dL

               4. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥60 mL/min, as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault
                  equation (refer to section 6.3.5 for calculator utility link)

          -  Female participants of reproductive potential (defined as women who have not been
             post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, ie, who have had menses within
             the preceding 24 months, or women who have not undergone surgical sterilization,
             specifically hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy)
             must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to study
             entry by any laboratory or clinic that has a CLIA certificate or its equivalent, or
             is using a point-of-care (POC)/CLIA-waived test. The serum, urine or POC pregnancy
             test must have a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL.

        Step 1 exclusion criteria for both cohorts (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2)

          -  Received investigational drug or device within 60 days prior to study entry.

          -  Chronic liver disease of a non-HCV etiology (eg, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease,
             α1 antitrypsin deficiency, primary sclerosing cholangitis).

          -  Presence of active or acute AIDS-defining opportunistic infections within 30 days
             prior to study entry. [NOTE: A list of AIDS-defining opportunistic infections as
             defined by the CDC, can be found in Appendix B of the following document:
             http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00018871.htm]

          -  Active, serious infection (other than HIV-1 or HCV) requiring parenteral antibiotics,
             antivirals, or antifungals within 30 days prior to study entry.

          -  Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) defined as HBsAg positive.

          -  Evidence of acute hepatitis A infection defined as HAV IGM positive.

          -  Chronic use of systemically administered immunosuppressive agents (eg, prednisone
             equivalent &gt; 10 mg/day).

          -  History of solid organ transplantation.

          -  Current or prior history of clinical hepatic decompensation (eg, ascites,
             encephalopathy or variceal hemorrhage).

          -  History of a gastrointestinal disorder (or post operative condition) that could
             interfere with the absorption of the study drug.

          -  History of significant or symptomatic pulmonary disease, cardiac disease, or
             porphyria.

          -  History of difficulty with blood collection and/or poor venous access for the
             purposes of phlebotomy.

          -  History of clinically significant illness or any other major medical disorder that
             may interfere with participant treatment, assessment, or compliance with study
             requirements, which may include active drug or alcohol use or dependence.

          -  Use of any prohibited concomitant medications within 30 days prior to study entry.

          -  Acute HIV infection defined as the phase immediately following infection during which
             anti-HIV antibodies are undetectable. [NOTE: Participants with early infection,
             defined as within the first 6 months of infection and with a positive HIV antibody,
             should be discussed with the A5327 protocol core team. These participants may be
             considered for inclusion in the study on a case by case basis with the specific
             documented approval of the protocol chairs.]

        Step 1 exclusion criteria for Cohort 1 only

          -  Prior exposure to a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) targeting the HCV NS5B polymerase.
