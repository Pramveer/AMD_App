  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, comparative, multicenter, 48-week study designed to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination treatment with pegylated interferon and
      ribavirin in adult subjects with a diagnosis of compensated chronic hepatitis C (hepatitis C
      virus (HCV)-ribonucleic acid (RNA) positive) (Genotype 1). All subjects will complete 24
      weeks of treatment, termed the Pilot Treatment Program, after which all eligible subjects
      will be randomly assigned to one of two study groups. One group will be followed for an
      additional 48 weeks without study medication, while the other will be continuously treated
      for an additional 24 weeks and then followed for another 24 weeks without study medication.
      Sustained virologic response, defined as undetectable HCV-RNA in serum at the end of the
      follow-up period, will be measured along with other outcomes.

      This is an open-label, randomized, comparative, multicenter study for evaluation of
      PegIntron/Ribavirin therapy in the efficacy and safety in adult subjects with a diagnosis of
      compensated chronic hepatitis C (HCV-RNA+) (Genotype 1). This is a 48-week study, for which
      all subjects should participate in the Pilot Treatment Program and complete 24 weeks
      treatment. To avoid a treatment gap, subjects who will be screened and eligible subjects
      will sign informed consent prior to the end of the Pilot Treatment Program. After completion
      of the Pilot Treatment Program, all eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to either
      study group. Subjects in the 24-Week Treatment arm will be followed-up without study
      medication for 48 weeks; subjects in the 48-Week Treatment arm will be continuously treated
      for another 24 weeks and all subjects in the 48-Week Treatment arm will be followed for
      another 24 weeks after completion of the treatment period. Subjects in both arms will be
      evaluated at screening, randomization, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 36 and 48 weeks after
      randomization.
