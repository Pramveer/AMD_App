  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if nitazoxanide in combination with peginterferon
      alfa-2a and ribavirin is safe and effective in treating chronic hepatitis C in patients that
      have previously failed to respond to treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin.
