      The Prime Study is a randomised trial investigating models of care for hepatitis C in the
      era of direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. The study aims to compare outcomes of
      hepatitis C care and DAA treatment provided in a primary health care service with a tertiary
      hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open label randomised trial will investigate the efficacy of treating people with G1
      HCV with DAA in primary healthcare services compared with tertiary hospital clinics. Three
      hundred and eighty G1 HCV infected patients attending study primary healthcare centres will
      be invited to participate in the study.

      At the primary healthcare centre participants will be randomly allocated to two groups:

      Group 1: (n=190) Following their initial screen, these participants will be referred to a
      tertiary hospital for transient elastography and DAA treatment (traditional model of care)

      Group 2: (n=190) Following their initial screen, these participants will be offered
      transient elastography and DAA treatment delivered at the primary healthcare service only.

      Treatment will consist of fixed dose combination paritaprevir, ombitasvir and ritonavir
      packaged together with dasabuvir, known as Viekira Pak, +/- weight based ribavirin. As
      cirrhotic patients will be excluded from the study, the duration of treatment is 12 weeks.

          -  Aged ≥18 years;

          -  Attendance at a study PHCS defined as; Attended appointment at PHCS at least once in
             2014 or; Attended at least one consultation with a study community hepatitis nurse
