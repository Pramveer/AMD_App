      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of an antidepressant
      (escitalopram) can prevent depressive episodes that appear during the treatment with
      peg-interferon and ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis C is a prevalent condition, and the main cause of chronic liver diseases,
      including cirrhosis and cancer. Nowadays, interferon-alfa in combination with ribavirin is
      the main treatment option for this condition. In the last years, interferon molecule has
      been modified in order to improve tolerance into pegylated interferon.

      Interferon-alfa has been associated with a high prevalence of psychiatric side effects,
      especially major depression (up to 25% of the cases), which is one of the main concerns
      about using this treatment. In fact, major depression is one of the main reasons of
      treatment withdrawal and treatment failure.

      Major depression induced by interferon-alfa can be successfully treated with
      antidepressants, but we don't know if antidepressants can also prevent the development of
      major depression, and if this can be a safe intervention. In the literature, there is only
      one controlled trial about this issue, in cancer patients, and some open studies in
      hepatitis C.

      In order to evaluate the efficacy, and safety, of an antidepressant (escitalopram) for
      preventing peginterferon's induced depressive episodes in patients with chronic hepatitis C,
      we have designed this 14-weeks placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial.
      Study interventions will be started two weeks before peginterferon + ribavirin's treatment
      onset.

      Subjects included in the study will be patients with chronic hepatitis C who are going to be
      treated with peginterferon-alfa2a + ribavirin, and without mental disorders requiring active
      psychotropic treatment.

      The main variables studied will be the appearance of a major depressive episode, following
      Diagnostic &amp; Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria, and the total score
      on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, along three assessment points at 4, 8 and
      12 weeks of treatment with interferon. There will also be a follow-up period of up to 6
      months after treatment with interferon is completed.

At least one of the symptoms is either depressed mood or loss of interest. Diagnoses were made by a trained psychiatrist who applied the mood disorders module from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, non-patient edition (SCID-I/NP) at each study evaluation.</description>

    <description>The MADRS is a 10-item scale, clinician-administered, which is sensitive to symptom change during antidepressant treatment. It has been frequently used to measure depressive symptoms during interferon-alpha therapy and exhibits improved internal consistency in patients with co-morbid medical conditions compared with other clinician-administered questionnaires.
Items are rated on a scale of 0-6. Scores range from 0 to 60, higher scores meaning higher levels of depression.</description>

    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is 14-item scale, patient-administered, that allows two independent scores of depression and anxiety. It has been specially designed to apply in patients with comorbid medical conditions as it excludes somatic or vegetative symptoms from the depression subscale.
We present data of de depression subscale. The seven-item Depression subscale yields a score of 0-21, with higher scores meaning higher levels of depressive symptoms.</description>
