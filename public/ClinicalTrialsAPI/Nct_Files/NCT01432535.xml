  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of peginterferon alfa-2b
      (Sylatron®) in healthy participants to that in participants with moderate to severe
      impairment of kidney function.

    <time_frame>From hour 0 (pre-dose) up to 288 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>CL/F is a calculation of the rate at which a drug is removed from the body via renal, hepatic and other clearance pathways, expressed as volume (milliliters) per unit of time (minutes).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vd/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>From hour 0 (pre-dose) up to 288 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Vd/F is defined as the distribution of a medication between the plasma and the rest of the body after the dose. It is the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired blood concentration of the drug.</description>
