  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and antiviral efficacy of sofosbuvir (SOF)
      with ribavirin (RBV) in participants with GT 1 and 3 and ledipasvir (LDV)/SOF in
      participants with genotype 1 and 4 HCV infection who have chronic renal insufficiency
      (impaired kidney function).

      Approximately 35 subjects with severe renal insufficiency (not on dialysis) will be enrolled
      in 3 cohorts.

        -  Cohort 1 (GT 1 or 3): 10 subjects will receive SOF 200 mg + RBV 200 mg once daily for
           24 weeks.

        -  Cohort 2 (GT 1 or 3): Following review of safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics (PK)
           data through post-treatment Week 4 of Cohort 1, 10 additional subjects will receive SOF
           400 mg + RBV 200 mg once daily for 24 weeks.

        -  Cohort 3 (GT 1 or 4): Following review of safety and available PK data through Week 12
           of Cohort 2, 15 additional subjects will receive LDV/SOF 90/400 mg once daily for 12
           weeks.

    <description>AUCtau is defined as the concentration of drug over time (area under the plasma concentration versus time curve over the dosing interval)
Cmax is defined as the maximum concentration of drug
Ctau is defined as the observed drug concentration at the end of the dosing interval</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>AUClast is defined as the concentration of drug from time zero to the last observable concentration
Clast is defined as the last observable concentration of drug
Tmax is defined as the time of Cmax
Tlast is defined as the time of Clast
λz is defined as the terminal elimination rate constant
t1/2 is defined as the estimate of the terminal elimination half-life of the drug</description>

    <time_frame>Up to Posttreatment Week 24</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Virologic failure will be measured by incidence of viral breakthrough and viral relapse.
Viral breakthrough is defined as HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after having previously had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ while receiving treatment, confirmed with 2 consecutive values (second confirmation value could be posttreatment), or last available on-treatment measurement with no subsequent follow-up values.
Viral relapse is defined as HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ during the post-treatment period having achieved HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at end of treatment, confirmed with 2 consecutive values or last available posttreatment measurement.</description>
