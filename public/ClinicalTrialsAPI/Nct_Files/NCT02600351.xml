    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir
      (LDV/SOF) fixed dose combination (FDC) for 12 weeks with or without ribavirin (RBV) in
      participants without cirrhosis, and LDV/SOF FDC for 12 weeks with RBV or LDV/SOF FDC for 24
      weeks without RBV in participants with cirrhosis.
