  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several psychiatric adverse events (eg, depression, fatigue, psychoses, behavior troubles,
      anxiety, irritability, deteriorated concentration, and insomnia) that are likely to occur
      during the treatment course with PegIntron plus Rebetol may prompt patients to discontinue
      their treatment early. The goal of this study is to assess whether a psychotherapy support
      program may contribute to a better adherence rate.
