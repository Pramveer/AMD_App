      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      ABT-450/ritonavir/ABT-267 (ABT-450/r/ABT-267; ABT-450 also known as paritaprevir; ABT-267
      also known as ombitasvir) and ABT-333 (also known as dasabuvir) coadministered with
      ribavirin (RBV) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1-infected adults with compensated
      cirrhosis.

      During the treatment period of the study, participants received treatment with
      ABT-450/ritonavir/ABT-267 and ABT-333 coadministered with RBV for either 12 or 24 weeks.
      Upon completing the treatment period or premature discontinuation of the treatment period,
      participants entered a 48-week post-treatment period.

    <description>Virologic failure during treatment was defined as rebound (confirmed HCV RNA greater than or equal to the lower limit of quantitation [≥ LLOQ] after HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ during treatment, or confirmed increase from the lowest value post baseline in HCV RNA [2 consecutive HCV RNA measurements &gt; 1 log(subscript)10(subscript) IU/mL above the lowest value post baseline] at any time point during treatment), or fail to suppress (HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ persistently during treatment with at least 6 weeks [≥ 36 days] of treatment).</description>

    <description>Participants were considered to have virologic relapse after treatment if they had confirmed quantifiable plasma Hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) ≥ lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) between the end of treatment and 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug among participants who completed treatment with HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at the end of treatment.</description>
