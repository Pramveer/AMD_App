  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Registry will enroll adolescent and pediatric participants who received at least one
      Gilead Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) direct acting antiviral (DAA) while participating in a
      Gilead-sponsored chronic hepatitis C clinical trial. The primary objective of this Registry
      is to determine the long-term safety of anti-HCV regimens in the pediatric population.
      Secondary objectives of this Registry are to determine whether subsequent detection of HCV
      RNA in participants who relapse following sustained virologic response (SVR) represents the
      re-emergence of pre-existing virus, the development of resistance mutations, or whether it
      is due to re-infection, and to characterize resistance mutations and the persistence of
      resistance mutations in pediatric participants who did not achieve SVR. Once enrolled,
      participants will be followed for up to 5 years.
