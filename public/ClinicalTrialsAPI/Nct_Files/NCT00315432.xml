      The purpose of this study was to describe the time course and extent of hemoglobin (Hb)
      changes and the erythropoietic response to PEG-IFN/RBV (Pegylated Interferon and
      Ribavirin)-induced anemia In HCV(hepatitis C virus)/HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)
      co-Infected subjects.

    <textblock>
      Patients receiving combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection
      (standard or pegylated interferon alfa [PEG-IFN] in combination with ribavirin [RBV])
      frequently develop moderate to severe anemia. In large, prospective, clinical trials of
      PEG-IFN alfa-2b and PEG-IFN alfa-2a, the reported mean decreases in hemoglobin (Hb) were 2.5
      g/dL, and 3.7 g/dL, respectively. Furthermore, in a retrospective study, 54% of standard
      interferon/RBV-treated patients had hemoglobin decreases of at least 3 g/dL. It is important
      to understand the causes, natural history, and risk factors associated with HCV
      therapy-induced anemia, because such decreases in hemoglobin can result in RBV dose
      reduction or discontinuation, which may decrease the likelihood of a virologic response by
      patient. Erythropoietin is an endogenous hormone that acts in the bone marrow to increase
      the number of erythroid progenitor cells (red blood cells). Normally, a decrease in the
      hemoglobin level is accompanied by an increase in the serum erythropoietin (sEPO) level,
      which will ultimately normalize the Hemoglobin level. The relationship between hemoglobin
      and serum erythropoietin is less apparent in patients with chronic diseases such as cancer
      and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. It is not known whether HCV/HIV
      co-infected patients receiving combination PEG-IFN/RBV therapy have a similarly diminished
      erythropoietic response to anemia. The objective of this study is to document the pattern of
      hemoglobin changes and erythropoietic response (from baseline to final assessment) in
      HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving combination therapy with IFN / RBV. N/A
