  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study retreatment in patients who failed prior treatment with interferon alpha (pegylated
      or non-pegylated) with or without ribavirin in a real-life setting in an
      observational/noninterventional study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational/non interventional study to collect data on the patient
      characteristics of those seeking retreatment as well as safety and efficacy information
      during the first 12 weeks of retreatment.

    <time_frame>Up to 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a medicinal product which did not necessarily have a causal relationship to the treatment. All AEs reported in the study were judged by the investigator to be clinically significant. An SAE was any adverse drug experience that resulted in death, was life-threatening, caused or prolonged hospitalization, caused persistent or significant disability or incapacity, caused a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or may have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of these outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Particular Adverse Events Resulting in Treatment Discontinuation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>All treatment discontinuations due to particular AEs were reported. These discontinuations included treatment stopped (TS) and dose reduced followed by treatment stopped (DR/TS).
The particular AE evaluated were anemia (low red blood cells), leucopenia (low white blood cells), neutropenia (low blood neutrophils), thrombocytopenia (low blood platelets), esophageal varices (dilated veins in lower esophagus), splenomegaly (enlarged spleen), portal hypertensive gastropathy (changes in stomach mucosa), and hepatomegaly (enlarged liver)</description>
