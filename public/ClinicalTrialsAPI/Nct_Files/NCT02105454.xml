    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 (GT1) who failed prior
      direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy will receive Grazoprevir (MK-5172) + Elbasvir
      (MK-8742) + Ribavirin (RBV) to evaluate sustained virologic response (SVR) using this drug
      combination.
