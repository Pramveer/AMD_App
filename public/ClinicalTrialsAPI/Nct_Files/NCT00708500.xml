  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves treatment with boceprevir or placebo in combination with pegylated
      interferon alfa-2b (PegIntron, PEG2b) + Ribavirin (RBV) (weight-based dosing [WBD]) in adult
      subjects with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1 who demonstrated interferon
      responsiveness (a decrease in hepatitis C virus RNA [HCV-RNA] viral load &gt;=2 log10 by Week
      12 or undetectable HCV-RNA at end of treatment) but who failed to achieve sustained
      virologic response (SVR) on prior treatment with any combination therapy of peginterferon
      alpha and RBV. This trial includes three arms, one control arm (PEG2b + RBV for 48 weeks)
      and two experimental arms (PEG2b + RBV + boceprevir). One of the experimental arms, Arm 3,
      consists of treatment with all three drugs for 44 weeks after the lead-in. The other
      experimental arm, Arm 2, consists of all three drugs for 32 weeks after the lead-in.
      Participants in Arm 2 who were undetectable for HCV-RNA at Treatment Week 8 will complete
      treatment at that point. Those who were not undetectable for HCV-RNA at Treatment Week 8
      will receive an additional 12 weeks of PEG2b + RBV + boceprevir placebo. It is hypothesized
      that the addition of a third active anti-HCV drug may lead to more rapid viral response than
      therapy with two drugs, and therefore, the addition of boceprevir to PEG2b plus RBV therapy
      after a 4-week lead-in period may allow for both increased rates of SVR and shorter
      treatment durations (in some populations) than treatment with peginterferon plus RBV alone.

    <description>Participants in Arm 2 (experimental) were assigned either a 36-week or 48-week course of therapy based on their HCV-RNA status at Treatment Week 8.
PEG2b + RBV (WBD) for 4 weeks followed by boceprevir + PEG2b + RBV (WBD) for 32 weeks, then:
36-week regimen: Participants who have undetectable HCV-RNA at Treatment Week 8 discontinue treatment and enter 36 weeks of post treatment follow-up.
48-week regimen: Participants who have detectable HCV-RNA at Treatment Week 8 are assigned an additional 12 weeks of therapy, followed by 24 weeks of post treatment follow-up. Placebo replaces boceprevir for the remaining 12 weeks of therapy, and this switch will occur in a blinded fashion.</description>
