      The purpose of this study is to investigate TMC435 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C
      virus (HCV) infection.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-year follow-up study in patients who completed a previous Phase II or III study
      in which they received TMC435, in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, for
      the treatment of hepatitis C infection. The entire study duration for each participant will
      be approximately 36 months. The medical follow-up of the patients will be performed
      according to the local standard of care. This study will evaluate the levels of virus in the
      blood circulation, as well as safety and alpha-fetoprotein testing and the change in
      sequence of HCV NS3/4A region over time in patients with confirmed detectable HCV RNA at
      last planned visit of the previous TMC435 study. In this study the development of liver
      disease progression will also be assessed. No medication will be administered in this study.
