        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed Informed Consent Form

             a) Signed written informed consent must be obtained from the subjects in accordance
             with requirements of the study center's IRB or IEC before the initiation of any
             protocol-required procedures.

          2. Target Population

             a) Healthy subjects as determined by no clinically significant deviation from normal
             in medical history, psychiatric history, physical examination findings, vital sign
             measurements, 12-lead ECG measurements, physical measurements, and clinical
             laboratory test results.

          3. Age and Reproductive Status

               1. Males and females, ages 25 to 55 years, inclusive.

               2. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy
                  test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours
                  prior to the start of study drug.

               3. Women must not be breastfeeding.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any significant acute or chronic medical illness.

          2. Current or recent (within 3 months of study drug administration) gastrointestinal

             complications are allowed at the investigator's discretion).

          3. Any major surgery within 4 weeks of study drug administration.

          4. Smokers (those who currently smoke, as well as those who have stopped smoking less
             than 6 months prior to the start of study drug administration).

          5. Any other sound medical, psychiatric, and/or social reason as determined by the
             investigator.
