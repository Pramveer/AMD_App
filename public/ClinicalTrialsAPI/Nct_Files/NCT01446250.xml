      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of alisporivir plus pegylated interferon
      alfa2a and Ribavirin as well as boceprevir plus pegylated interferon alfa2a and Ribavirin in
      African American chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 patients that have never received treatment
      for their hepatitis C.

    <description>Eligible participants receive response-guided treatment with Peg-IFN injection once weekly plus oral Ribavirin BID plus oral DEB025 400mg BID for 24 or 48 weeks based on week 4 and week 12 HCV RNA results.
DEB025/ peg-IFN alpha 2a/RBV response-guided treatment duration:
Patients with a viral load below the level of quantification (LOQ) at week 4 and below the level of detection (LOD) at week 12 will stop peg-IFN alpha 2a/RBV and DEB025 study medications after 24 weeks.
Patients with a viral load at or above the level of quantification (LOQ) at week 4 or above the level of detection (LOD) at week 12 will complete 48 weeks of peg-IFN alpha 2a/RBV and DEB025 study treatment</description>

    <description>Eligible participants receive per boceprevir(BOC) label response-guided treatment of Peg-IFNalpha2a(Peg-IFN) injection once weekly plus oral Ribavirin(RBV) BID for 4 wks followed by Peg-IFN injection once weekly plus oral RBV BID plus oral BOC 800mg TID for 24, 32 or 44 wks based on week 8 and week 24 HCV RNA results and compensated cirrhosis diagnosis.
Response-guided treatment: Pts with viral load (VL) below level of detection (LOD) at wk8 and VL below LOD at wk24 will stop peg-IFN,RBV and BOC at wk 28.
Pts with VL above LOD at wk 8 and VL below LOD at wk24 will stop BOC at wk 36 and will stop peg-IFN,RBV at wk48. Pts with compensated cirrhosis will stop peg-IFN,RBV and BOC at wk48.
Pts with serum HCV RNA concentration &gt;= 100 IU/mL at wk12, confirmed VL above LOD at wk24, incomplete viral response with rebound or confirmed viral breakthrough at any time will be offered treatment with DEB025,peg-IFN,RBV for 48 wks plus 24 wks treatment-free followup.</description>
