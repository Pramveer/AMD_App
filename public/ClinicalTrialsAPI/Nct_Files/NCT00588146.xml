      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pegylated interferon

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pegylated
      interferon alpha-2b (PEG-Intron) in patients with severe complications related to Hereditary
      Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT). Participants will be randomized to the treatment arm or
      control arm and then crossed over to the alternate arm at 6 months for the remainder of the
      12-month study. Study treatment will consist of weekly subcutaneous injections of pegylated
      interferon alpha-2b (PEG-Intron), 1 microgram/kilogram/week. Adverse events as well as
      monitoring and treatment of toxicities will be followed as stated in the protocol. Adverse
      events will be graded according to the Modified NCI Common Toxicity Criteria. After every
      five participants have completed one month of treatment, an independent data safety
      monitoring board will review any adverse events.
