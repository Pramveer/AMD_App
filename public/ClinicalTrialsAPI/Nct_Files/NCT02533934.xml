      Pilot, open-label study using fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir /ledipasvir to treat
      HIV/HCV coinfected pre or post liver transplant participants
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty HIV/HCV coinfected liver transplant candidates and recipients with HCV infection will
      be enrolled into this study. Approximately 25 pre-transplant and 25 post-transplant patients
      will be included.

      The cohort of wait-listed patients with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C will be treated with
      SOF/LDV until LT or for a maximum of 24 weeks. Patients with and without HCC within Milan
      criteria are eligible.

      Another cohort of liver transplant recipients with recurrent HCV infection post liver
      transplant will also be treated with SOF/LDV for a period of 12 weeks (no cirrhosis) or 24
      weeks (cirrhosis). Patients with fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis are eligible and will be
      treated for 12 weeks.

      Starting with Day 0, all subjects will receive SOF/LDV for 12 or up to 24 weeks. The total
      amount of time required to complete all the study visits is approximately 56 - 68 weeks from
      the screening period through the end of the follow-up visits:

        -  Up to 8 weeks Screening period

        -  12 or 24 week treatment period

        -  12 and 24 week post-treatment follow-up visits (SVR12 and SVR24)

        -  36 weeks post-treatment to assess late viral relapse

             due to complications of HCV-cirrhosis

          4. Have HIV-1 infection and either:

               1. On protocol approved HIV medications for at least 4 weeks WITH an HIV viral load
                  less than the level of detection OR

               2. On no HIV medications for at least 8 weeks WITH a CD4 count of 500 cells/mm3 or

                  least 3 months

          5. Chronic HCV infection as documented by at least one measurement of plasma HCV RNA ≥
             1,000 IU/mL during screening and at least one of the following: A positive anti-HCV
             antibody, HCV RNA, or an HCV genotype test at least 12 months prior to baseline (Day

             days prior to the study that may confound the assessment of study drug safety.
