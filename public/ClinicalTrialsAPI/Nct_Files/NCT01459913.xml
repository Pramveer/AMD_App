  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if a 12-week total regimen of telaprevir in
      combination with pegylated interferon alfa 2a (Peg-IFN-alfa-2a) and ribavirin (RBV)
      (T12/PR12) is safe and effective in subjects who have the interleukin-28B (IL28B) CC
      genotype. The subjects enrolled in this study will have chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      infection and will not have cirrhosis of the liver.

             therapy of standard duration and never achieved undetectable HCV RNA while on
             treatment

          -  Subjects have evidence of hepatic decompensation

          -  Subjects have evidence of cirrhosis

          -  Subjects have diagnosed or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma

          -  Subjects have any other cause of significant liver disease in addition to hepatitis
             C, which may include but is not limited to malignancy with hepatic involvement,
             hepatitis B, drug or alcohol-related cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis,
