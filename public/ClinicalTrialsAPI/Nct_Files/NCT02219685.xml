  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of sustained virologic response (SVR) on cerebral
      metabolism as determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and on neurocognition as
      measured by neurocognitive tests. This study will also evaluate the antiviral efficacy,
      safety, and tolerability of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) fixed dose combination (FDC) for
      12 weeks in treatment-naive or treatment-experienced adults.

      During the blinded treatment phase, participants will be randomized 2:1 to receive LDV/SOF
      FDC or placebo to match for 12 weeks. After the unblinding at the posttreatment Week 4
      visit, participants in the placebo group will be offered open-label treatment.
