      The major goal of this project is to identify the role of the immune responses in the
      emergence of protease inhibitor mutants during therapy.

      Objective 1: Evaluate the role of the immune responses in determining the emergence of HCV
      NS3 resistance mutation during protease inhibitor therapy

      Hypothesis 1 (HT 1): Low HLA binding to peptides containing protease inhibitor resistance
      mutations is associated with the emergence of protease inhibitor mutants during therapy and
      failure of the treatment.

      Hypothesis 2 (HT 2): A hole in T cell repertoire may allow emergence of protease inhibitor
      mutants during protease inhibitor therapy which leads to loss of the immune responses to
      these mutants and failure of treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria: All chronically HCV-infected patients who fail peg-IFN and RBV therapy
        and are eligible for combined treatment with PI therapy will be enrolled. Briefly, this
        includes:

          1. Male or female

          2. Age 18 to 65

          3. Chronic HCV infection evidenced by liver biopsy or persistent HCV viremia for &gt;6
             months

          4. Treatment experienced and classified as non-responder or relapser to prior
             interferon-based therapy.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Treatment na√Øve chronically HCV-infected patients.

          2. Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) or suspected IBD,
             autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, and any patients on systemic
             immunomodulators.

          3. Pregnancy

          4. HIV
