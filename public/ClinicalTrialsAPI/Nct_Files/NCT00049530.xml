      RATIONALE: Peginterferon (PEG-interferon) alfa-2b may stop the growth of cancer by stopping
      blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of PEG-interferon alfa-2b in treating
      patients who have stage IV melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the ability of low-dose PEG-interferon alfa-2b to suppress plasma basic
           fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) levels to normal in patients with metastatic melanoma
           over-expressing b-FGF.

        -  Determine the antitumor effect of this drug, in terms of progression-free and overall
           survival and tumor response, in these patients.

        -  Correlate tumor activity of this drug with b-FGF and vascular endothelial growth factor
           levels in the plasma and urine of these patients.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) once weekly. Treatment continues
      until basic fibroblast growth factor level is suppressed to normal or until a maximum weekly
      dose is reached. If there is disease progression, patients then discontinue treatment. If
      there is no disease progression, patients receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b SC weekly for up to
      1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.

    <description>The primary endpoint was the suppression of plasma b-FGF level with low dose peginterferon alfa-2b. A clinically important reduction of plasma b-FGF levels was determined to be a level less than or equal to 7.5 pg/mL. A patient was considered to have a suppressed plasma b-FGF level, if the patient experienced the clinically significant reduction (less than or equal to 7.5 pg/mL) of plasma b-FGF levels for two consecutive determinations which were at least three weeks apart. This was considered as a b-FGF response.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Non-progression Rate (Clinical Response to Peginterferon Alfa-2b)</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed every 9 weeks until suppression of plasma b-FGF level to normal, every 12 weeks until the completion of 12 months of treatment, &gt;= 4 weeks after documented response. After off treatment, every 3 months if &lt;2 years, and every 6 months if 2-3 years</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Objective tumor response was assessed using RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) 1.0 criteria. Per RECIST criteria, complete response (CR) = disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Partial response (PR)= &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions from baseline, and persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or the maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. Progression is defined as at least 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the baseline measurements, or the appearance of one or more new lesion(s) or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Stable disease (SD) = did not meet criteria for response or progression.
Non-progression rate = CR + PR + SD.</description>
