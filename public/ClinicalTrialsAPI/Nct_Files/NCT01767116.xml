      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and antiviral activity of
      ABT-450/ritonavir/ABT-267 (ABT-450/r/ABT-267; ABT-450 also known as paritaprevir; ABT-267
      also known as ombitasvir) and ABT-333 (also known as dasabuvir) with and without ribavirin
      (RBV) in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (HCV GT1b) infection without
      cirrhosis.

      A randomized, double-blind, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and antiviral activity
      of the combination of ABT-450/ritonavir/ABT-267 (ABT-450/r/ABT-267) and ABT-333 with and
      without ribavirin (RBV) in treatment-naïve, noncirrhotic participants with chronic hepatitis
      C virus genotype 1b (HCV GT1b) infection.

    <description>The percentage of participants with sustained virologic response (plasma Hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid [HCV RNA] level less than the lower limit of quantitation [&lt; LLOQ]) 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug. The LLOQ for the assay was 25 IU/mL.
The primary efficacy endpoints were noninferiority of the percentage of participants who achieved sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment in each treatment arm (ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333, plus either placebo RBV or RBV) compared with the historical control rate for noncirrhotic, treatment-naïve participants with HCV GT1b infection treated with telaprevir and peginterferon/RBV (pegIFN).</description>

    <description>The percentage of participants with sustained virologic response (plasma Hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid [HCV RNA] level less than the lower limit of quantitation [&lt; LLOQ]) 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug.
The secondary endpoint was the noninferiority of the percentage of participants who achieved sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment who received ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333, plus placebo RBV compared with those who received ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333, plus RBV.</description>

    <description>The percentage of participants with sustained virologic response (plasma HCV RNA less than the lower limit of quantitation [&lt; LLOQ]) 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug.
The secondary efficacy endpoints were superiority of the percentage of participants who achieved sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment in each treatment arm (ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333, plus either placebo RBV or RBV) compared with the historical control rate for noncirrhotic, treatment-naïve participants with HCV GT1b treated with telaprevir and pegIFN/RBV.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Virologic failure during treatment was defined as rebound (confirmed HCV RNA greater than or equal to the lower limit of quantitation [≥ LLOQ] after HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ during treatment, or confirmed increase from the lowest value post baseline in HCV RNA [2 consecutive HCV RNA measurements &gt; 1 log10 IU/mL above the lowest value post baseline] at any time point during treatment), or failure to suppress (HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ persistently during treatment with at least 6 weeks [≥ 36 days] of treatment).</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Participants who completed treatment with plasma HCV RNA less than the lower limit of quantification (&lt;LLOQ) at the end of treatment were considered to have virologic relapse if they had confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ during the post-treatment period.</description>
