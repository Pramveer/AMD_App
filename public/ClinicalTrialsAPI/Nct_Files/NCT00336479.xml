    <description>AE: any adverse change from the subject's baseline (pre-treatment) condition, including any adverse experience, abnormal recording or clinical laboratory assessment value which occurs during the course of the study, whether it is considered related to the study drug or not. An adverse event includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug. SAE: medical event or condition, which falls into any of the following categories, regardless of its relationship to the study drug: death, life threatening adverse experience, in-patient hospitalization/prolongation of hospitalization, persistent/significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, important medical event. &quot;Study drug&quot; includes all investigational agents (including placebo, if applicable) administered during the course of the study.</description>
