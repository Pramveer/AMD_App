  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2-arm study will compare the efficacy and safety of treatment with Pegasys (180 µg
      weekly) plus Copegus (800 mg daily) and Pegasys (180 µg weekly) plus Copegus (1000-1200 mg
      daily) in interferon-naive patients with CHC genotype 1 co-infected with HIV-1. Treatment
      will be administered for 48 weeks, and this will be followed by 24 treatment-free weeks. The
      anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500
      individuals.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sustained Virological Response (SVR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 72</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>SVR was defined by the percentage of patients with undetectable Hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) at 24 weeks after completion of the 48-week treatment period (i.e., a single last HCV RNA &lt; 20 IU/mL measured ≥ Day 477 [≥ Week 68]). Patients without an HCV measurement at the end of the 24-week untreated follow-up period were considered nonresponders.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Adverse Events, Dose Reductions and Withdrawals Due to Anemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 72</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Adverse events of anemia included hemolytic anemia, aplasia pure red cell, and pancytopenia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Virological Response at End of Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Virological response at the end of the treatment period was defined as a single last HCV RNA measurement &lt;20 IU/mL at the completion of the treatment period (Days 324 to 351). Patients without an HCV measurement at Week 48 were considered nonresponders.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Virological Response at Weeks 4, 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Virological response at Weeks 4, 12 and 24 was also defined as a single last undetectable HCV RNA (&lt; 20 IU/mL) falling within the visit windows of Days 16 to 43, 72 to 99, and 156 to 183, respectively. Patients without an HCV measurement at a study week were considered nonresponders at that study week.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relapse of Virological Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 48 and 72</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Relapse of virological response was calculated by dividing the number of patients who achieved a virological response at the end of treatment but had detectable HCV RNA at the last assessment posttreatment by the number of patients with a virological response at the end of treatment who had at least one HCV RNA assessment posttreatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rapid Virological Response (RVR) by Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>RVR was defined as an undetectable HCV RNA &lt; 20 IU/mL (a single last HCV RNA &lt; 20 IU/mL falling in the time window of Days 2 to 43). Patients without an HCV measurement by Week 4 were considered nonresponders.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Early Virological Response (EVR), Partial EVR and Complete EVR by Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>EVR: Undetectable HCV RNA &lt;20 IU/mL or ≥2 log10 drop from pretreatment level, by Week 12 (a single last HCV RNA &lt;20 IU/mL or ≥2 log10 drop from pretreatment level in the time window of Days 2 to 99). Partial EVR: Detectable HCV RNA but ≥2 log10 drop from pretreatment, by Week 12 (a single last HCV RNA detectable but ≥2 log10 drop from pretreatment in the time window of Days 2 to 99). Complete EVR: Undetectable HCV RNA &lt;20 IU/mL, by Week 12 (a single last HCV RNA &lt;20 IU/mL in the time window of Days 2 to 99). Patients without an HCV measurement by Week 12 were considered nonresponders.</description>
