    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      antiviral activity of ABT-450 with ritonavir (ABT-450/r) dosed in combination with ABT-072
      and ribavirin (RBV) in treatment-naïve participants with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C
      virus (HCV) infection.

      This was a Phase 2a multicenter, open-label, single arm, combination treatment study of a
      regimen of ABT-450/r/ABT-072, and ribavirin (RBV) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1-(1a
      or 1b) infected treatment-naïve participants.
