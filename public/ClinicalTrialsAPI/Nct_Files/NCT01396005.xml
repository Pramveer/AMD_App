  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants on methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone maintenance therapy will
      be given boceprevir. Blood samples will be taken at specified intervals to find out whether
      boceprevir affects the pharmacokinetics of methadone, buprenorphine, or naloxone.

    <measure>Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC) at Steady State of Methadone Enantiomers When Administered With or Without Boceprevir</measure>
    <time_frame>Methadone samples collected Day 1, 0 (predose) through 24 hours post-dose (Day 2). Boceprevir and methadone samples collected Day 7, 0 (predose) through 24 hours post-dose (Day 8). Predose samples also collected on Days 5-6.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>AUC is a measure of the amount of drug in the blood over time, measured at steady state (time at which the amount of drug eliminated by the body is in equilibrium with the amount taken in). The Day 1, 0 through 24 hour samples were for methadone levels in the absence of boceprevir co-administration. The Day 7, 0 through 24 hour samples were for methadone levels in the presence of boceprevir co-administration. The Day 5 and 6 predose samples were to check steady state for methadone + boceprevir.</description>
