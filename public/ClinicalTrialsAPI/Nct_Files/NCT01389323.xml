    <description>SVR12 was defined as Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) RNA levels &lt;lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), (target detected or target not detected) at Post-treatment Week 12. The limit of detection for HCV RNA was 10 IU/mL and the LLOQ was 25 IU/mL. For analysis purpose, participants were assigned to following 3 race/ethnicity cohorts: Black/African American, Latino, and White non-Latino. Some participants were represented in more than one race/ethnicity cohort.</description>

    <description>The limit of detection for HCV RNA levels was 10 IU/mL and the LLOQ was 25 IU/mL. Data for post-treatment Weeks 36 and 48 were based on participants who had achieved virologic response (defined as HCV RNA levels &lt;LLOQ, target not detected) at both Weeks 4 and 12, and completed 24 weeks of study treatment. For analysis purpose, participants were assigned to following 3 race/ethnicity cohorts: Black/African American, Latino, and White non-Latino.

    <description>An AE was defined as any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a pre-existing condition that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. SAE was defined as a medical event that at any dose resulted in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity; was life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or required or prolonged hospitalization. Treatment-related AE was defined as an AE that had certain, probable, possible, or unknown relationship to study drug. For analysis purpose, participants were assigned to following 4 race/ethnicity cohorts: Black/African American, White/Caucasian, Latino and Non-Latino. Some participants were represented in more than one race/ethnicity cohort.</description>
