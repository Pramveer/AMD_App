    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the costs associated with peginterferon alfa-2b
      (PegIntron) plus ribavirin (Rebetol) treatment for chronic hepatitis C in the Czech
      Republic. Only costs associated with rescue medication, concomitant therapy, disease
      monitoring, and medical intervention costs recognized by the treating institution as
      treatment-related expenses will be included in the analysis. The study will also evaluate
      the correlation between hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy-related costs with ribavirin dosing
      and participant history.

    <description>SVR is defined as undetectable HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) six months after the end of treatment. Cost per participant with SVR was calculated as a ratio of the total costs for all participants and the number of participants with SVR in the given group. All costs were adjusted for inflation to 2010 values.</description>
