  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the antiviral efficacy of sofosbuvir (SOF)/ledipasvir (LDV)
      fixed-dose combination (FDC) with and without ribavirin (RBV), and to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of each regimen as assessed by review of the accumulated safety data.
      Approximately 150 participants with genotype 1 HCV infection, who have previously received
      treatment for HCV, and who have a diagnosis for cirrhosis will be enrolled. Participants
      will be randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      Group 1: SOF/LDV FDC tablet plus placebo to match RBV for 24 weeks

      Group 2: Delayed treatment group: placebo to match SOF/LDV FDC plus placebo to match RBV for
      12 weeks, followed by SOF/LDV FDC once daily plus RBV in a divided daily dose for 12 weeks

      Randomization will 1:1 to the two groups and will be stratified by HCV genotype (1a, 1b;
      mixed or other genotype 1 results will be stratified as genotype 1a), and prior HCV therapy
      treatment response (never achieved HCV RNA &lt; the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), or
      achieved HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ).

1 participant who was randomized to the LDV/SOF + RBV group received LDV/SOF + placebo, and is counted in the LDV/SOF group for the safety analysis, and in the LDV/SOF+RBV group for the efficacy analysis (ie, in the Full Analysis Set).</description>

    <description>Virologic failure is defined as
On-treatment virologic failure:
Breakthrough (confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after having previously had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ while on treatment), or

Non-response (HCV RNA persistently ≥ LLOQ through 8 weeks of treatment)
Virologic relapse:
Confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ during the posttreatment period having achieved HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at last on-treatment visit.</description>
