  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relapse of acute leukemia, MDS and blast phase CML after allogeneic transplantation
      affects approximately 1/3 to 1/2 of all transplant recipients and is the main cause of
      treatment failure. There is currently no effective standard treatment for this condition.

      This study will test the activity and feasibility of using a regimen to boost the immune
      system in order to treat AML, ALL, blast phase CML, and MDS relapse after allogeneic
      transplantation.

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot phase II open label study testing the activity and feasibility of utilizing
      a regimen to boost the immune system in order to treat AML, ALL, blast phase CML, and MDS
      relapse after allogeneic transplantation. The regimen is a step-wise use of withdrawal of
      immunosuppression, cytoreduction if needed, administration of granulocyte-macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and pegylated interferon (IFN) α-2b to patients who
      relapsed after an allogeneic transplant and will assess efficacy.

      Relapse is the major problem following allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplants.
      There is currently no standard way to treat leukemia that relapsed after transplant, and
      patients have a poor prognosis.

      A retrospective analysis of patients treated at Emory showed that administration of GM-CSF
      and interferon-alpha-2b was well-tolerated and affected long-term remissions in a small
      number of relapsed patients (after allogeneic transplant). Pre-clinical and clinical data
      from ours and other centers showed that relapsed leukemic blasts have down-regulation of
      co-stimulatory molecules and a tendency to evade the immune system. Cytokines can
      up-regulate co-stimulatory molecules on leukemic blasts and have been shown to increase the
      cytotoxicity of T-cells. This effect may be beneficial as a graft vs. leukemia effect for
      patients with relapse after allogeneic transplant.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &gt; 1 year.

          2. Patients who have received an allogeneic transplant to treat AML, ALL, MDS, or CML
             and have relapse or progression of their AML, ALL, MDS, or CML are eligible to
             participate in the study. Relapse is defined as: reappearance of leukemic blasts as
             determined by morphologic analysis of the blood or marrow, reappearance of a
             phenotypic population of leukemia blasts by flow cytometric analysis of the blood or
             marrow, reappearance of a chromosome abnormality which is associated with the
             original leukemia as determined by chromosomal or FISH testing (ex: a translocation
             between chromosomes 9 and 22 for CML), reappearance of the molecular marker which is
             associated with the original leukemia as determined by polymerase chain reaction
             (PCR) (ex: breakpoint cluster region [BCR]-Abelson murine leukemia [ABL] for CML or
             ALL).

             *Patients who received allogeneic transplantation to treat AML, ALL, MDS, or CML with
             detectable disease, and did not achieve remission of their leukemia after transplant
             are eligible.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt; 2 for adults, and
             Lansky status 60% for children.

          4. Liver functions tests (AST/alanine aminotransferase [ALT]/bilirubin) &lt; 5x the upper
             limit of normal.

          5. Creatinine &lt; 3x the upper limit of normal.

          6. Lack of active grade 2-4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) 3 weeks after
             discontinuation of immunosuppression.

          7. Patients with limited stage and extensive stage chronic GVHD of mild severity
             (lichenoid changes), or requiring &lt; prednisone 10 mg/m² daily will be included.

             cytokines.

          2. Allergy to components of interferon-alpha-2b or GM-CSF.

          3. Current uncontrolled infection.

          4. Current grade 2-4 acute GVHD or chronic extensive GVHD of moderate to severe nature,
             requiring treatment with more than 10 mg/m² of prednisone daily.

          5. Uncompensated heart failure, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV:

               -  Class I: patients with no limitation of activities; they suffer no symptoms from

               -  Class II: patients with slight, mild limitation of activity; they are
                  comfortable with rest or with mild exertion;

               -  Class III: patients with marked limitation of activity; they are comfortable
                  only at rest;

               -  Class IV: patients who should be at complete rest, confined to bed or chair; any
                  physical activity brings on discomfort and symptoms occur at rest.
