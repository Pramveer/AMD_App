    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of sofosbuvir
      (GS-7977; PSI-7977) administered in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin
      (PEG/RBV) in treatment-naive patients with HCV genotypes 1,4,5,6, or indeterminate genotype.
