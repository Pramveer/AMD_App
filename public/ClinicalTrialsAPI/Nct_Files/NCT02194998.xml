  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are diseases that share the same risk factors and
      routes of transmission. For this reason, many people infected with HIV are also infected
      with HCV. Interferon is a drug used to treat HCV; however, in people coinfected with HIV and
      HVC, interferon treatment does not work well and can cause unwanted side effects. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of
      interferon-free HCV treatment in HIV/HCV coinfected adults who are taking antiretroviral
      (ARV) therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of a combination of
      three different drugs to treat HCV in adults who are coinfected with HIV and HCV. The three
      drugs are ABT-450/r/ABT-267, ABT-333, and ribavirin (RBV).

      The study will enroll 100 HIV/HCV-coinfected participants aged 18 to 70 years. The
      participants will never have received treatment for HCV, but will be on an antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) regimen containing either raltegravir (RAL) or darunavir (DRV). (The ART
      regimens will not be provided by the study.) The participants will be assigned to one of
      four groups (Groups A, B, C, and D). Participants in Groups A and B will be on RAL-based
      ART; participants in Groups C and D, on DRV-based ART. For each group, the study will
      proceed in two steps: Step 1: on-HCV treatment and Step 2: post-HCV treatment. During Step 1
      of the study, all participants will take the same study-provided HCV drugs. Participants in
      Groups A and C will receive the HCV drugs for 24 weeks; participants in Groups B and D, for
      12 weeks.

      Total study duration will be up to 48 weeks. During Step 1 (on-HCV treatment), all
      participants will have study visits at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10. Participants in
      Groups A and C will have additional Step 1 study visits at Weeks 12, 16, and 20, with a
      treatment completion visit at Week 24. Participants in Groups B and D will have a treatment
      completion visit at Week 12.

      All participants will have Step 2 (post-treatment) study visits 4, 12, and 24 weeks after
      registration to Step 2. Participants in Groups B and D will have an additional Step 2 visit
      36 weeks after registration to Step 2.

      All study visits will include a brief physical exam and blood collection. Select study
      visits will include pregnancy testing for participants able to become pregnant, an
      electrocardiogram (EKG), an interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP 10) test, and
      collection of plasma samples.

      Some participants may take part in an optional substudy. Participants in the substudy will
      attend two study visits at entry/Day 0 and Week 4 for 12-hour intensive pharmacokinetic (PK)
      sampling.
