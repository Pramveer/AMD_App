  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is open to participants with cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV),
      and to participants who have already received a liver transplant for chronic HCV. All
      subjects will be treated with Daclatasvir and Sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. Under certain
      conditions, the treatment duration may be extended for cirrhotic participants . The study
      will test how well this combination of investigational drugs works to treat chronic HCV.

    <description>SVR12 was defined as hepatitis C Virus (HCV) RNA levels to be &lt; lower limit of quantitation i.e., 25 IU/mL target detected or target not detected, at post-treatment Week 12.

For participants who missed the follow-up Week 12 visit, SVR12 was imputed using the next and closest available HCV RNA measurement after the follow-up Week 12 window.</description>

             of the cervix, adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or
             hepatocellular carcinoma within Milan criteria for transplantation) within 5 years
             prior to screening

          -  Evidence of an ongoing medical condition contributing to chronic liver disease other
             than HCV (such as, but not limited to: hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis,
             metabolic liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, or toxin exposures)

          -  History of HIV infection or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) as documented by HBV
             serologies (e.g., HBsAg-seropositive). Participants with resolved HBV infection may
             participate (e.g., HBcAb-seropositive with concurrent HBsAg-seronegative)

          -  Active hospitalization for decompensated liver disease
