  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the antiviral efficacy, safety, and
      tolerability of therapy with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) fixed-dose combination (FDC)
      and ribavirin (RBV) in participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) who have previously
      failed a direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-containing regimen.

    <description>Virologic failure is defined as:
On-treatment virologic failure:
Breakthrough (confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after having previously had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ while on treatment), or
Rebound (confirmed &gt; 1 log10 IU/mL increase in HCV RNA from nadir while on treatment), or
Non-response (HCV RNA persistently ≥ LLOQ through 8 weeks of treatment)
Virologic relapse:
Confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ during the posttreatment period having achieved HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at last on-treatment visit.</description>
