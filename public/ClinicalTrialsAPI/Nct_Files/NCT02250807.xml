  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show superiority of simeprevir (SMV) in combination with
      sofosbuvir for 12 weeks versus a historical control. Historical control will be a composite
      of the observed historical sustained virological response at Week 12 (SVR12) rates of SMV in
      combination with (pegylated) interferon (PegIFN)/ribavirin (RBV) of the subpopulations in
      study HPC3011 (NCT01567735) and will depend on the percentage of treatment-naive, prior
      relapser, prior non-responder, interferon (IFN)-intolerant and other subjects enrolled in
      this study.

      This is a Phase 3, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      single-arm, multicenter study (conducted at multiple sites). The study consists of 3
      periods: a Screening period (up to 4 weeks), Treatment period (12 Weeks) and Post treatment
      follow-up period (until 24 weeks after end of treatment). The duration of the subjects'
      participation will be approximately 40 weeks. In the treatment period subjects will receive
      oral capsule simeprevir along with oral tablet sofosbuvir once daily for 12 weeks. Primarily
      efficacy will be evaluated as percentage of subjects with sustained virologic response at
      Week 12 after the end of treatment. Subjects' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
