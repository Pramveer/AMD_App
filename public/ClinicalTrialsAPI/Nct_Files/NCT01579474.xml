        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Chronic hepatitis C infection, diagnosed by positive anti-HCV antibodies and detected
             HCV RNA at screening in addition to:

               -  positive anti-HCV antibodies or detected HCV RNA at least 6 months before
                  screening; or,

               -  liver biopsy consistent with chronic HCV infection.

          2. HCV genotype 1 infection confirmed by genotypic testing at screening

          3. (For Cohort 1 only) Therapy-na√Øve to interferon, pegylated interferon, and ribavirin
             (For Cohort 2 only) Confirmed prior virological failure (null response, partial
             response, breakthrough or relapse) with an approved dose of PegIFN alfa/RBV or IFN
             beta/RBV for at least 12 weeks and with an 8-week washout period before screening

          4. HCV RNA = 100,000 IU/mL at screening

          5. Documentation of a liver biopsy within 3 years or fibroscan within 6 months before
             randomization (Visit 2)

          6. Age 20 to 70 years

          7. Female patients who are infertile or who are of childbearing potential with a
             negative pregnancy test and agreeing to use one accepted method of birth control in
             addition to the use of a condom by their male partners.

             or Male patients who are infertile, who are without pregnant female partners or who

             screening,

          2. Evidence of acute or chronic liver disease due to causes other than chronic HCV
             infection. Steatosis diagnosed incidentally (e.g. by biopsy) without clinical
             relevance is not an exclusion criterion.

          3. HIV co-infection,

          4. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection based on presence of hepatitis B surface antigen

          8. Usage of any investigational drugs within 30 days prior to screening, or planned
             usage of an investigational drug during the course of this study,

             immunomodulatory treatment within 30 days prior to screening. Patients being treated
             with oral antivirals such as acyclovir, famciclovir or valacyclovir for recurrent
             herpes simplex infection; or with oseltamivir or zanamivir for influenza A infection,
             may be screened,

         10. Received silymarin (milk thistle), glycyrrhizin (Stronger Neo-Minophagen C; SNMC), or
             Sho-saiko-to (SST) within 28 days prior to randomization (Visit 2) and throughout the
             treatment phase of this trial,

         11. (For Cohort 2 only) Patients who have been previously treated with at least one dose
             of any antiviral or immunomodulatory drug other than (pegylated) interferon alfa,
             interferon beta or ribavirin for acute or chronic HCV infection including and not
             restricted to protease or polymerase inhibitors,

         12. Known hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the study drugs,

         13. Alpha fetoprotein value &gt;100 ng/mL at screening; if &gt;20 ng/mL and =100 ng/mL,
             patients may be included if there is no evidence of liver cancer in an appropriate
             imaging study (e.g., ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI) within last 6 months prior to
             randomization (Visit 2),

        Other exclusion criteria related to pegylated interferon and/or ribavirin restrictions are
        not listed here.
