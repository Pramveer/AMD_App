  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm study of sofosbuvir (GS-7977) and ribavirin (RBV) in
      adults who have had a liver transplant which has become re-infected with hepatitis C. The
      treatment period is 24 weeks with up to 48 weeks of follow up. The total time in this study
      will last up to 72 weeks not including the screening visit.
