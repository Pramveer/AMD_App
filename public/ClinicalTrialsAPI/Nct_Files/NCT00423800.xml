  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIIB randomized, controlled, multi-centre, open-label study of 24 versus 48
      weeks therapy with Pegetron® (peginterferon alfa-2b + ribavirin) at standard doses in naïve
      Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotype 1 high viral load (HVL) participants who are Hepatitis C
      Virus-Ribonucleic Acid (HCV-RNA) negative at Week 4. HVL will be defined as HCV-RNA of
      &gt;600,000 IU/mL prior to the initiation of therapy. Participants with genotype 1 baseline HVL
      prescribed Pegetron® (peginterferon and ribavirin) in the usual manner in accordance with
      the marketing authorization and who are viral negative at Week 4 will be randomized at Week
      8 to receive a total of 24 or 48 weeks of therapy. Participants will be required to have
      their baseline and Week-12 viral load analyzed by the same local laboratory using the
      standard of care test used by the site. Qualitative testing at Week 4, 8, 16-20, 24, and 48
      may be conducted either by local laboratory or a central laboratory identified by the
      sponsor using an assay specified by the sponsor. No additional interventions outside of the
      clinic's standard of care and the conditions of the Canadian product monograph for Pegetron®
      will be applied to participants.

    <description>Participants were tested for the presence of Hepatitis C Virus-Ribonucleic Acid (HCV-RNA) in blood by Qualitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). If the HCV-RNA is not detectable, the participant is negative for HCV-RNA.
Sustained virologic responders were participants negative for HCV-RNA at 24 weeks following the completion of therapy. A Participant that withdrew prior to 24 weeks following the completion of therapy was considered a non-responder.</description>

Virological relapse in participants was defined as having negative virology (HCV-RNA) at end of treatment, but positive virology (HCV-RNA) again at 24 weeks of follow up post treatment.</description>
