    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, multi-center, single dose, two-period, two-sequence
      crossover study to investigate the bioequivalence of PEG-IFN alfa-2a BA-free formulation
      versus the reference market formulation (PEG-IFN alfa-2a [Pegasys®]) following subcutaneous
      administration via prefilled syringe in healthy Chinese participants.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy female and male Chinese participants, 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive, at
             the time of screening

          -  Body mass index between 19 and 28 kg/m2, inclusive

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential: willing to use highly effective
             methods of contraception throughout the study and for 90 days after the last dosing

          -  Male participants: agreement to remain abstinent or use spermicide and barrier method
             contraception throughout the study and for 90 days after the last dosing

          -  Able to participate and willing to give written informed consent and to comply with
             the study restrictions

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically relevant condition or history of cardiovascular, psychiatric,
             gastrointestinal, respiratory, renal, hepatic, hematological, lymphatic, neurological
             (including seizure history), musculoskeletal, genitourinary, immunological,
             metabolic, malignant, or dermatological disorder

          -  Any other condition or disease (other than those already stated) which, in the
             judgment of the Investigator, would place the participant at undue risk, interfere
             with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of PEG-IFN alfa-2a, or
             interfere with the ability of the participant to complete the study

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within the last year before screening

          -  Treatment with interferon or PEG-IFN alfa-2a within 3 months prior to the first
             dosing

          -  Female participants who are pregnant, currently lactating, or have a positive serum
             pregnancy test at screening or have a positive urine pregnancy test on Day -1 of
             Period 1

          -  Use of any prescribed or over the counter medication or herbal medicine taken within
             14 days prior to the first dosing or within 5 times the elimination half-life of the
             medication prior to the first dosing (whichever is longer). Exceptions are
             paracetamol, the contraceptive pill, hormone replacement therapy and commonly used
             vitamin supplements, which are permitted

          -  Regular smoking with consumption of more than 10 cigarettes per day or an equivalent
             amount of tobacco

          -  Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 3 months prior to the
             first dosing
