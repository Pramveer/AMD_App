    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of co-administration of
      ABT-450 (also known as paritaprevir) with ritonavir (ABT-450/r) and ABT-267 (also known as
      ombitasvir) in adults with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 2, randomized, open-label, combination treatment study of the 2-DAA regimen
      (ABT-450 150 mg QD + ritonavir 100 mg QD + ABT-267 25 mg QD) in adult HCV GT1b-infected
      treatment-naïve and pegIFN/RBV treatment-experienced participants without cirrhosis and with
      compensated cirrhosis, and in adult GT4-infected treatment-naïve and pegIFN/RBV
      treatment-experienced participants without cirrhosis. Safety and efficacy data through 18
      June 2014 are included in this interim analysis. Treatment Group 5 was not open to
      enrollment, based on a protocol-specified interim review of results from the treatment-naïve
      GT4 Groups 1 and 4 that indicated higher sustained virologic response (SVR) rates among
      participants receiving the 2-DAA regimen with RBV. All other study groups completed the
      treatment period and completed through Week 12 of the post-treatment period. Groups 2 and 3
      completed the study (through post-treatment Week 48), Groups 1 and 4 completed through
      post-treatment Week 24, and Groups 6, 7, and 8 completed through post-treatment week 12.

    <description>Participants were considered to have virologic relapse after treatment if they had confirmed quantifiable plasma Hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) ≥ lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) between the end of treatment and 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug among participants who completed treatment with HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at the end of treatment.</description>
