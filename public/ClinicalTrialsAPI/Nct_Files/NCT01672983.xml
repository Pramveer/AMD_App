      This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, antiviral activity, and pharmacokinetics of
      ABT-450 (also known as paritaprevir) with ritonavir (ABT-450/r) and ABT-267 (also known as
      ombitasvir) in adult Japanese patients with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (HCV GT1b)
      or genotype 2 (HCV GT2) infection who were previous treated with pegylated
      interferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV).

    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-arm, combination treatment study
      consisted of a Treatment and Post-treatment Phase, divided into 2 cohorts: 1) chronic HCV
      GT1b- infected, pegIFN/RBV treatment-exposed Japanese adults; and 2) HCV GT2-infected,
      pegIFN/RBV treatment-exposed Japanese adults. The Treatment Phase evaluated the antiviral
      activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics of a range of ABT-450/r and ABT-267 doses for 12 to
      24 weeks. The Post-treatment Phase evaluated the evolution and persistence of viral
      resistance to ABT-267 and ABT-450.

    <description>The percentage of participants with SVR24 (plasma Hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid [HCV RNA] level less than the lower limit of quantitation [&lt; LLOQ] 24 weeks after the last dose of study drug). The LLOQ for the assay was 25 IU/mL.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>TEAEs: up to 16 weeks for the 12-week treatment groups and up to 28 weeks for the 24-week treatment groups; SAEs: up to 65 weeks for the 12-week treatment groups and up to 77 weeks for the 24-week treatment groups.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that results in death, is life-threatening, results in or prolongs hospitalization, results in congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, spontaneous or elective abortion, or requires intervention to prevent a serious outcome. AEs were rated for severity as either Mild: transient and easily tolerated; Moderate: causes discomfort and interrupts usual activities; or Severe: causes considerable interference with usual activities, may be incapacitating or life-threatening. AEs related to study drug were assessed as being either probably or possibly related by the investigator. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were collected from the first dose of study drug administration to 30 days after last dose; SAEs were collected from the time that informed consent was obtained to 30 days after last dose.</description>

    <description>The percentage of participants with SVR12 (plasma HCV RNA level &lt; LLOQ 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug). The LLOQ for the assay was 25 IU/mL.</description>

    <description>The percentage of participants with EOT response (plasma HCV RNA level &lt; LLOQ at week 12 for the 12-week duration arms and Week 24 for the 24-week duration arms12). The LLOQ for the assay was 25 IU/mL.</description>
