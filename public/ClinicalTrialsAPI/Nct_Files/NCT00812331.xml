  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess anti-viral activity (inhibition of viral growth) of
      TMC435350 in genotype 2,3,4,5 and 6 hepatitis C virus infected participants who have never
      received treatment for their hepatitis C infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) study to assess the
      antiviral activity, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (explores what the body does
      to the medication) of TMC435350 hereafter referred to as TMC435. Approximately 40
      participants will be divided in 5 groups as per the genotype (8 participants each group).
      The study will include a screening phase (up to 6 weeks), treatment phase (7 days) and a
      follow-up phase (30-35 days after the last dose of study medication). Safety evaluations
      will include assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests and cardiovascular
      safety.
