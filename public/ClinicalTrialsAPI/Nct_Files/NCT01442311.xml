  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug users account for a disproportionately large burden of hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      infection. However, HCV treatment adherence rates in drug users may be suboptimal in
      patients who use drugs regularly during HCV treatment. Because HCV treatment is most
      effective when patients adhere to at least 80% of the prescribed treatment regimen,
      interventions to improve HCV treatment adherence need to be developed and evaluated. The
      investigators designed the HCV DOT trial to test the efficacy of two versions of modified
      directly observed HCV therapy provided on-site at a methadone clinic. The primary objective
      of this trial is to determine whether enhanced DOT with both pegylated interferon alfa-2a
      plus ribavirin (PEG/RBV-DOT) is more efficacious than standard DOT with weekly
      provider-administered pegylated interferon (PEG-DOT) and self-administered ribavirin for
      increasing adherence and improving HCV treatment outcomes. The investigators hypothesize
      that PEG/RBV-DOT is associated with increased adherence and rates of sustained viral
      response compared with PEG-DOT.

    <description>Subjects randomized to the PEG/RBV-DOT arm receive weekly provider-administered pegylated interferon alfa-2a injections plus modified directly observed ribavirin therapy. We describe this as modified because ribavirin ingestion is observed at the methadone window three to six days per week based on the participants' methadone pick-up schedule, and only one of two daily doses is observed.</description>
