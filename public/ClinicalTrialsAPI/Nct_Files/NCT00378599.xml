      This is an exploratory study and is a Phase 3, single-arm, multi-center, open-label study of
      pegylated interferon alfa-2b, PEG-IFN alpha-2b (PEG-Intron) and ribavirin (RBV) to determine
      the sustained virologic response (SVR) at 24-week follow-up to 48 week in subjects after
      orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) recurrence.

At the end of Weeks 2 and 4 of Treatment (tx), a complete blood count (CBC) was performed. An increase in RBV dose was permitted only if the hemoglobin was &gt;10 g/dL. At Weeks 3 and 4, RBV dose was 800 mg (4 capsules, 2 AM and 2 PM). From Weeks 5 to 48, RBV doses could be increased based on subject body weight. For subjects weighing &lt;65 kg, maximum dose of RBV was to be 800 mg (4 capsules, 2 AM and 2 PM), for subjects weighing 65-85 kg, max dose of RBV was 1000 mg/day (5 capsules, 2 AM and 3 PM), for subjects weighing &gt;85 kg, max dose of RBV was 1200 mg/day, 6 capsules, 3 AM and 3 PM).</description>

          -  Subject must be transplanted for end-stage hepatitis C or fulminant hepatitis C.

          -  Subject must have documented:

               -  persistent HCV viremia after OLT as defined by plasma positive for HCV RNA by
                  quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),

               -  A liver transplant performed at least 3 months prior to screening but not more
                  than 3 years prior to screening.

          -  Subject must be on stable doses of immunosuppression for at least 1 month.
