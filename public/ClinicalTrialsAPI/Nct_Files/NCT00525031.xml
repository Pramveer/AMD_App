      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if temozolomide alone or given with
      pegylated interferon alpha-2b can help to control metastatic melanoma. Researchers also want
      to study the safety of these 2 treatments.

      Objectives:

        1. To determine the anti-tumor activity (pathological response CR+PR) and toxicity of
           temozolomide (TMZ) alone or in combination with pegylated interferon alpha-2b (PGI) in
           patients with resectable stage IIIC or stage IV (M1a) metastatic melanoma prior to
           definitive surgical resection.

        2. To determine the relapse-free survival, overall survival and the impact of tumor
           response to chemotherapy in these patients.

        3. To differentiate the in vivo treatment effects of TMZ alone vs.TMZ plus PGI and
           correlate with clinical outcome by analysis the pre- and post-treatment tumors and
           peripheral blood mononuclear cells with respect to:

      1) Known cellular and molecular markers of apoptosis and cell proliferation, 2) Promotor
      methylation status of the DNA repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT),
      3) DNA sequence variability of tumor suppressor genes and DNA repair enzymes, 4) Tumor
      genomic expression profiles analysis by cDNA microarray and protein array

      Temozolomide is a drug that is designed to work by stopping cancer cells from making new
      DNA. If they cannot make DNA, they can't split into 2 new cancer cells.

      Pegylated Interferon alpha-2b is a protein made by the human immune system that helps to
      fight viral infections and regulate cell function.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned
      (as in the toss of a coin) to one of two treatment groups (Arm A or Arm B). You have an
      equal chance of being assigned to either group and getting the treatment assigned to that
      group. You will not know which group you are assigned to.

      Arm A: Participants in this group will take temozolomide once a day for 7 days in a row.
      This will be followed by 7 days without any treatment. This will be repeated 3 more
      times(for a total of 8 weeks - 1 cycle) before you have routine surgery.

      Arm B: Participants in this group will take temozolomide on the same schedule as those in
      Arm A. However, participants in this group will also receive pegylated interferon alpha-2b
      as an injection under the skin once a week for a total of 8 weeks before they have routine
      surgery. Tylenol will be given to participants in this group before their pegylated
      interferon alpha-2b injection. After the first injection, they will also need to stay in the
      clinic for 2 hours of observation.

      Your body weight will be used when calculating the dosage of Temozolomide.

      You will have blood (about 1 tablespoon each time) drawn at 2 times, to check your response
      to treatment. The first sample will be drawn before you start treatment. The second sample
      will be drawn around Day 57 of treatment.

      On Days 15, 29, 43, and 57 of treatment, you will be asked about any illness you have
      experienced and any medications you may be taking. You will have a physical exam, including
      measurement of vital signs. You will have tumor measurements and a performance status
      evaluation. You will also have about 1 tablespoon of blood drawn for routine tests at each
      visit . Any side effects you may have experienced will also be recorded.

      All participants will receive 1 cycle (8 weeks) of treatment followed by surgery to remove
      the tumor. The size of the tumor will be closely monitored during study treatment. If the
      tumor increases in size by 50% (half) or greater, study treatment will be stopped and you
      will immediately have surgery. If you have to stop treatment due to side effects from the
      drug(s), you may be able to start up again once the side effect has gone away or decreased
      in severity enough. However, the time you are off therapy will count towards the total 8
      weeks that you can receive treatment. If recovery from the side effect requires a total of 8
      weeks or more from the start of treatment, you will be removed from the study and receive
      surgery. Tumor and blood samples will be collected during surgery to check how the disease
      is responding to treatment.

      Your routine surgery will be scheduled to take place up to 90 days following completion of
      your treatment and as soon as your blood counts have recovered to the normal level.

      After surgery, if you are experiencing side effects from the study drugs, but show stable
      disease or you are responding to treatment, you will be able to receive 3 additional cycles
      of therapy (24 weeks). You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs
      and routine blood tests (about 1 tablespoon) every 4 weeks. You will then be followed every
      3 months with routine blood tests (about 1 tablespoon each time) for the first 3 years, and
      every 6 months up to 8 years. After that, follow-up will be at the discretion of your
      primary physician. CT scans of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be performed after each
      cycle of therapy for the 3 additional cycles, then every 6 months up to 5 years and then, at
      the discretion of your primary physician.

      This is an investigational study. Temozolomide alone and given with pegylated interferon
      alpha-2b is authorized for use in research only. Neither of these drugs is currently
      approved by the FDA for this treatment. About 124 patients will be enrolled on this study.
      All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

             c.) SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 3 times
             upper limit of laboratory normal.

          6. Patients have not had any previous systemic chemotherapy for metastatic melanoma.
             Prior biologic therapy, targeted therapy or immunotherapy are allowable, but must be

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Significant cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction, such as a history of severe
             cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction within 6 months of the start of
             treatment, unstable angina, Class III or Class IV congestive heart failure,
             ventricular arrhythmia, or any uncontrolled arrhythmia.
