  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous intravenous drug abusers with chronic hepatitis C who are under substitution
      therapy (buprenorphine, methadone) will be treated with PegIntron and Rebetol according to
      the approved European labeling. The study will assess the tolerability, safety and efficacy
      of the treatment with PegIntron plus Rebetol in this study population. The objective of the
      study is to collect data on the prevalence of the hepatitis C infections in drug-substituted
      patients. The study will also compare the feasibility of HCV (Hepatitis C Virus) treatment
      in patients receiving Subutex® vs other drug substitution pharmacotherapies.
